	abstract = {The Yakima River Reservoir system supplies water to {\textasciitilde}180,000 irrigated hectares through the operation of five reservoirs with cumulative storage of {\textasciitilde}30\% mean annual river flow. Runoff is derived mostly from winter precipitation in the Cascade Mountains, much of which is stored as snowpack. Climate change is expected to result in earlier snowmelt runoff and reduced summer flows. Effects of these changes on irrigated agriculture were simulated using a reservoir system model coupled to a hydrological model driven by downscaled scenarios from 20 climate models archived by the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. We find earlier snowmelt results in increased water delivery curtailments. Historically, the basin experienced substantial water shortages in 14\% of years. Without adaptations, for IPCC A1B global emission scenarios, water shortages increase to 27\% (13\% to 49\% range) in the 2020s, to 33\% in the 2040s, and 68\% in the 2080s. For IPCC B1 emissions scenarios, shortages occur in 24\% (7\% to 54\%) of years in the 2020s, 31\% in the 2040s and 43\% in the 2080s. Historically unprecedented conditions where senior water rights holders suffer shortfalls occur with increasing frequency in both A1B and B1 scenarios. Economic losses include expected annual production declines of 5\%–16\%, with greater probabilities of operating losses for junior water rights holders.},

	volume = {62},
	issn = {0165-0009},
	abstract = {The potential effects of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Basin were evaluated using ensemble climate simulations generated by the U. S. Department of Energy and National Center for Atmospheric Research Parallel Climate Model (DOE/NCAR PCM). Five PCM scenarios were employed. The first three were ensemble runs from 1995 - 2099 with a 'business as usual' global emissions scenario, each with different atmospheric initializations. The fourth was a 'control climate' scenario with greenhouse gas emissions set at 1995 levels and run through 2099. The fifth was a historical climate simulation forced with evolving greenhouse gas concentrations from 1870 - 2000, from which a 50-year portion is taken for use in bias-correction of the other runs. From these global simulations, transient monthly temperature and precipitation sequences were statistically downscaled to produce continuous daily hydrologic model forcings, which drove a macro-scale hydrology model of the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Basins at a 1/8-degree spatial resolution, and produced daily streamflow sequences for each climate scenario. Each streamflow scenario was used in a water resources system model that simulated current and predicted future performance of the system. The progressive warming of the PCM scenarios (approximately 1.2 degreesC atmidcentury, and 2.2 degreesC by the 2090s), coupled with reductions in winter and spring precipitation ( from 10 to 25\%), markedly reduced late spring snowpack ( by as much as half on average by the end of the century). Progressive reductions in winter, spring, and summer streamflow were less severe in the northern part of the study domain than in the south, where a seasonality shift was apparent. Results from the water resources system model indicate that achieving and maintaining status quo ( control scenario climate) system performance in the future would be nearly impossible, given the altered climate scenario hydrologies. The most comprehensive of the mitigation alternatives examined satisfied only 87 - 96\% of environmental targets in the Sacramento system, and less than 80\% in the San Joaquin system. It is evident that demand modification and system infrastructure improvements will be required to account for the volumetric and temporal shifts in flows predicted to occur with future climates in the Sacramento - San Joaquin River basins.},

	doi = {10.1175/bams-d-12-00228.1},
	abstract = {The Colorado River is the primary water source for more than 30 million people in the United States and Mexico. Recent studies that project streamf low changes in the Colorado River all project annual declines, but the magnitude of the projected decreases range from less than 10\% to 45\% by the mid-twenty-first century. To understand these differences, we address the questions the management community has raised: Why is there such a wide range of projections of impacts of future climate change on Colorado River streamflow, and how should this uncertainty be interpreted? We identify four major sources of disparities among studies that arise from both methodological and model differences. In order of importance, these are differences in 1) the global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios used; 2) the ability of land surface and atmospheric models to simulate properly the high-elevation runoff source areas; 3) the sensitivities of land surface hydrology models to precipitation and temperature changes; and 4) the methods used to statistically downscale GCM scenarios. In accounting for these differences, there is substantial evidence across studies that future Colorado River streamflow will be reduced under the current trajectories of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions because of a combination of strong temperature-induced runoff curtailment and reduced annual precipitation. Reconstructions of preinstrumental streamflows provide additional insights; the greatest risk to Colorado River streamf lows is a multidecadal drought, like that observed in paleoreconstructions, exacerbated by a steady reduction in flows due to climate change. This could result in decades of sustained streamflows much lower than have been observed in the {\textasciitilde}100 years of instrumental record.},

	doi = {10.1029/2010jd015001},
	abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is one of the inputs to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). A common approach to calculating PDSI is to use the Thornthwaite method for estimating PET because of its readily available input data: monthly mean temperatures. PET estimates based on Penman-type approaches are considered to be more physically realistic, but require more diverse input data. This study assesses the differences in global PDSI maps using the two estimates for PET. Annually accumulated PET estimates based on alternative Thornthwaite and Penman-Monteith, parameterizations have very different amplitudes. However, we show that PDSI values based on the two PET estimates are very similar, in terms of correlation, regional averages, trends, and in terms of identifying extremely dry or wet months. The reason for this insensitivity to the method of calculating PET relates to the calculations in the simple water balance model which is at the heart of the PDSI algorithm. It is shown that in many areas, actual evapotranspiration is limited by the availability of soil moisture and is at markedly lower levels compared to its potential value. In other areas, the water balance does change, but the quantity central to the calculation of the PDSI is, by construction, a reflection of the actual precipitation, which makes it largely insensitive to the use of the Thornthwaite PET rather than the Penman-Monteith PET. A secondary reason is that the impact of PET as input to a scaling parameter in the PDSI algorithm is very modest compared to the more dominant influence of the precipitation.},

Models were designed to take only significantly correlated areas into account in the downscaling procedure, By using particularly precipitable water in combination with wind speeds at 850 hPa, correlation coefficients between observed and estimated precipitation exceeding 0.8 were reached. The correlations exhibited a seasonal variation with higher values during autumn and winter than during spring and summer. The SVD analysis preceding the model development highlighted three important features of the rainfall regime in southern Japan: (1) the so-called Bai-u front which is responsible for the majority of summer rainfall, (2) the strong circulation pattern associated with autumn rainfall, and (3) the strong influence of orographic lifting creating a pronounced east-west gradient across Kyushu Island. Results confirm the feasibility of establishing meaningful statistical relationships between atmospheric state and basin rainfall even at time scales of less than one day.},

The basis of the analysis is information taken from a climate change simulation performed with a state-of-the-art general circulation model (the Hadley Centre model). First, it is shown that the model is unable to reproduce accurately the statistics of daily maximum and minimum temperature at the site. Second, using a re-analysis data set, downscaling models are developed to predict site temperature from large-scale free atmosphere variables derived from the sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height fields. In particular, the relative performances of linear models and non-linear artificial neural networks are compared using a set of rigorous validation techniques. It is shown that even a simple configuration of a 2-layer non-linear neural network significantly improves on the performance of a linear model. Finally, the non-linear neural network model is initialised with general circulation model output to construct scenarios of daily temperature at the present day (1970-79) and for a future decade (2090-99). These scenarios are analysed with special attention to the comparison of the frequencies of heat waves (days with maximum temperature greater than 35 degreesC) and cold spells (days with minimum temperature below 5 degreesC).},

	abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR "Water Cycle Across Scales" initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.},

Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase downwelling infrared radiation, and this global heating at the surface not only acts to increase temperatures but also increases evaporation which enhances the atmospheric moisture content. Consequently all weather systems, ranging from individual clouds and thunderstorms to extratropical cyclones, which feed on the available moisture through storm-scale moisture convergence, are likely to produce correspondingly enhanced precipitation rates. Increases in heavy rainfall at the expense of more moderate rainfall are the consequence along with increased runoff and risk of flooding. However, because of constraints in the surface energy budget, there are also implications for the frequency and/or efficiency of precipitation. It follows that increased attention should be given to trends in atmospheric moisture content, and datasets on hourly precipitation rates and frequency need to be developed and analyzed as well as total accumulation.},

	title = {An analogue-based method to downscale surface air temperature: application for {Australia}},
	volume = {17},
	abstract = {A statistical model (SM) has been developed to downscale large- scale predictors given by general circulation models (GCMs); emphasis has been put on local surface air temperature in two areas of interest: the south-west corner (SWC) of Western Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeastern Australia. This is a complementary approach to the dynamical modelling of climate change using high-resolution nested regional models. The analogue technique was chosen for this study as it has proven successful in the past for midlatitude climate and, in particular, for forecasting in Australia. Furthermore, the analogue technique is successful in reproducing spells of anomalous events. The development and validation datasets used for both predictors and predictants cover the 1970-1993 period. Predictors are extracted from a dataset of operational analyses for the Australian region. Several predictors have been assessed alone and combined. Mean sea level pressure and temperature at 850 hPa have been identified as the most useful combination. Predictants have come from quality controlled stations with daily temperature extremes for the 1970-1993 period. Twenty two stations in the SWC and 29 in the MDB have been selected. The sensitivity of the SM has been tested to several internal parameters. The number of atmospheric predictors and the geographical domain on which large-scale fields are used are key factors that maximise the skill of the SM. Several metrics have been tested taking into account the state of the predictors on the day or, in order to describe the evolution of the atmosphere, over several days. This latter has been particularly useful in improving the representation of anomalous spells as it partially incorporates the auto-correlation of surface temperature. The correlation obtained between the observed local temperature series and the reconstructed series ranges between 0.5 and 0.8. Best results are obtained in summer and for maximum temperature. The reproduction of spells is satisfactory for most stations. The SM is then applied to large-scale fields obtained from a GCM forced by observed sea surface temperature; the improvement gained when using the SM instead of relying on the surface temperature calculated by the GCM is shown.},

This research explored the potential of using the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), for seasonal predictions of ETo over the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The 12-km ETo forecasts were produced by downscaling coarse-scale ETo forecasts from the CFSv2 retrospective forecast archive and by downscaling CFSv2 maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (Rs), and wind speed (Wind) individually and calculating ETo using those downscaled variables. All the ETo forecasts were calculated using the Penman?Monteith equation. Sensitivity coefficients were evaluated to quantify how and how much does each of the variables influence ETo. Two statistical downscaling methods were tested: 1) spatial disaggregation (SD) and 2) spatial disaggregation with quantile mapping bias correction (SDBC). The downscaled ETo from the coarse-scale ETo showed similar skill to those by first downscaling individual variables and then calculating ETo. The sensitivity coefficients showed Tmax and Rs had the greatest influence on ETo, followed by Tmin and Tmean, and Wind. The downscaled Tmax showed highest predictability, followed by Tmean, Tmin, Rs, and Wind. SDBC had slightly better performance than SD for both probabilistic and deterministic forecasts. The skill was locally and seasonally dependent. The CFSv2-based ETo forecasts showed higher predictability in cold seasons than in warm seasons. The CFSv2 model could better predict ETo in cold seasons during El Niño?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events only when the forecast initial condition was in either the El Niño or La Niña phase of ENSO.},

	abstract = {Rural agriculture in the Bolivian Altiplano is vulnerable to climate related shocks including drought, frost, and flooding. We examine multimodel, multiscenario projections of eight precipitation and temperature extreme indices for the Altiplano and compute temperature indices for La Paz/Alto, covering 1973-2007. Significant increasing trends in observed warm nights and warm spells are consistent with increasing temperatures in the tropical Andes. The increase in observed frost days is not simulated by the models in the 20th century, and projections of warm nights, frost days, and heat waves are consistent with projected annual cycle temperature increases; PDFs are outside their 20th century ranges by 2070-2099. Projected increases in precipitation extremes share the same sign as observed trends at Patacamaya and are consistent with annual cycle projections indicating a later rainy season characterized by less frequent, more intense precipitation. Patacamaya precipitation indices show shifts in observed distributions not seen in the models until 2020-2049, implying that precipitation changes may occur earlier than projected. The observed increase in frost days can be understood within the context of precipitation changes and an increase in radiative cooling. Model warm/wet biases suggest that a decrease in frost days may not occur as early or be as large as projected. Nevertheless, consistencies between simulated and observed extremes, other than frost days, suggest the directions of projected changes are reliable. These results are a first step toward providing the critical information necessary to reduce threats to food security and water resources in the Altiplano from changing climate.},

This needs to be recognized for scientific uses, and precision can only be achieved if the particular definition is identified in each use to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding. For quantitative purposes, possible definitions are explored that match the El Ninos identified historically after 1950, and it is suggested that an El Nino can be said to occur if 5-month running means of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Nino 3.4 region (5 degrees N-5 degrees S, 120 degrees-170 degrees W) exceed 0.4 degrees C for 6 months or more. With this definition, El Ninos occur 31\% of the time and La Ninas (with an equivalent definition) occur 23\% of the time. The histogram of Nino 3.4 SST anomalies reveals a bimodal character. An advantage of such a definition is that it allows the beginning, end, duration, and magnitude of each event to be quantified. Most El Ninos begin in the northern spring or perhaps summer and peak from November to January in sea surface temperatures.},

Here, we investigate the influence of sea level rise on expected storm surge-driven water levels and their frequencies along the contiguous United States. We use model output for global temperature changes, a semi-empirical model of global sea level rise, and long-term records from 55 nationally distributed tidal gauges to develop sea level rise projections at each gauge location. We employ more detailed records over the period 1979–2008 from the same gauges to elicit historic patterns of extreme high water events, and combine these statistics with anticipated relative sea level rise to project changing local extremes through 2050. We find that substantial changes in the frequency of what are now considered extreme water levels may occur even at locations with relatively slow local sea level rise, when the difference in height between presently common and rare water levels is small. We estimate that, by mid-century, some locations may experience high water levels annually that would qualify today as ‘century’ (i.e., having a chance of occurrence of 1\% annually) extremes. Today’s century levels become ‘decade’ (having a chance of 10\% annually) or more frequent events at about a third of the study gauges, and the majority of locations see substantially higher frequency of previously rare storm-driven water heights in the future. These results add support to the need for policy approaches that consider the non-stationarity of extreme events when evaluating risks of adverse climate impacts.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1300005110},
	abstract = {Climate change mitigation acts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus curbing, or even reversing, the increase in their atmospheric concentration. This reduces the associated anthropogenic radiative forcing, and hence the size of the warming. Because of the inertia and internal variability affecting the climate system and the global carbon cycle, it is unlikely that a reduction in warming would be immediately discernible. Here we use 21st century simulations from the latest ensemble of Earth System Model experiments to investigate and quantify when mitigation becomes clearly discernible. We use one of the scenarios as a reference for a strong mitigation strategy, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and compare its outcome with either RCP4.5 or RCP8.5, both of which are less severe mitigation pathways. We analyze global mean atmospheric CO2, and changes in annually and seasonally averaged surface temperature at global and regional scales. For global mean surface temperature, the median detection time of mitigation is about 25–30 y after RCP2.6 emissions depart from the higher emission trajectories. This translates into detection of a mitigation signal by 2035 or 2045, depending on whether the comparison is with RCP8.5 or RCP4.5, respectively. The detection of climate benefits of emission mitigation occurs later at regional scales, with a median detection time between 30 and 45 y after emission paths separate. Requiring a 95\% confidence level induces a delay of several decades, bringing detection time toward the end of the 21st century.},

The patterns are compared to those obtained from the previous set of experiments, under CMIP3. We estimate the significance of the emerging differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 results through a bootstrap exercise, while also taking into account the fundamental differences in scenario and model ensemble composition. All in all, the robustness of the geographical features in patterns of temperature and precipitation, when computed as multi-model means, is confirmed by this comparison. The intensity of the change (in both the warmer and cooler areas with respect to global temperature change, and the drier and wetter regions) is overall heightened per degree of global warming in the ensemble mean of the new simulations. The presence of stabilized scenarios in the new set of simulations allows investigation of the performance of the technique once the system has gotten close to equilibrium. Overall, the well established validity of the technique in approximating the forced signal of change under increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is confirmed.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions lock in long-term sea-level rise that greatly exceeds projections for this century, posing profound challenges for coastal development and cultural legacies. Analysis based on previously published relationships linking emissions to warming and warming to rise indicates that unabated carbon emissions up to the year 2100 would commit an eventual global sea-level rise of 4.3–9.9 m. Based on detailed topographic and population data, local high tide lines, and regional long-term sea-level commitment for different carbon emissions and ice sheet stability scenarios, we compute the current population living on endangered land at municipal, state, and national levels within the United States. For unabated climate change, we find that land that is home to more than 20 million people is implicated and is widely distributed among different states and coasts. The total area includes 1,185–1,825 municipalities where land that is home to more than half of the current population would be affected, among them at least 21 cities exceeding 100,000 residents. Under aggressive carbon cuts, more than half of these municipalities would avoid this commitment if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet remains stable. Similarly, more than half of the US population-weighted area under threat could be spared. We provide lists of implicated cities and state populations for different emissions scenarios and with and without a certain collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Although past anthropogenic emissions already have caused sea-level commitment that will force coastal cities to adapt, future emissions will determine which areas we can continue to occupy or may have to abandon.},

	abstract = {AbstractUsing the hybrid downscaling technique developed in part I of this study, temperature changes relative to a baseline period (1981?2000) in the greater Los Angeles region are downscaled for two future time slices: midcentury (2041?60) and end of century (2081?2100). Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are considered, corresponding to greenhouse gas emission reductions over coming decades (RCP2.6) and to continued twenty-first-century emissions increases (RCP8.5). All available global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are downscaled to provide likelihood and uncertainty estimates. By the end of century under RCP8.5, a distinctly new regional climate state emerges: average temperatures will almost certainly be outside the interannual variability range seen in the baseline. Except for the highest elevations and a narrow swath very near the coast, land locations will likely see 60?90 additional extremely hot days per year, effectively adding a new season of extreme heat. In mountainous areas, a majority of the many baseline days with freezing nighttime temperatures will most likely not occur. According to a similarity metric that measures daily temperature variability and the climate change signal, the RCP8.5 end-of-century climate will most likely be only about 50\% similar to the baseline. For midcentury under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and end of century under RCP2.6, these same measures also indicate a detectable though less significant climatic shift. Therefore, while measures reducing global emissions would not prevent climate change at this regional scale in the coming decades, their impact would be dramatic by the end of the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {This study documents the temperature variance change in two different versions of a coupled ocean\&\#8211;atmosphere general circulation model forced with estimates of future increases of greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol concentrations. The variance changes are examined using an ensemble of 8 transient integrations for the older model version and 10 transient integrations for the newer one. Monthly and annual data are used to compute the mean and variance changes. Emphasis is placed upon computing and analyzing the variance changes for the middle of the twenty-first century and compared with those found in a control integration.The large-scale variance of lower-tropospheric temperature (including surface air temperature) generally decreases in high latitudes particularly during fall due to a delayed onset of sea ice as the climate warms. Sea ice acts to insolate the atmosphere from the much larger heat capacity of the ocean. Therefore, the near-surface temperature variance tends to be larger over the sea ice\&\#8211;covered regions, than the nearby ice-free regions. The near-surface temperature variance also decreases during the winter and spring due to a general reduction in the extent of sea ice during winter and spring.Changes in storminess were also examined and were found to have relatively little effect upon the reduction of temperature variance. Generally small changes of surface air temperature variance occurred in low and midlatitudes over both land and oceanic areas year-round. An exception to this was a general reduction of variance in the equatorial Pacific Ocean for the newer model. Small increases in the surface air temperature variance occur in mid- to high latitudes during the summer months, suggesting the possibility of more frequent and longer-lasting heat waves in response to increasing GHGs.},

	volume = {256},
	abstract = {The goal of the paper is to present a model for generating daily precipitation time series and its applications to two climatologically different areas. The rainfall is modeled as stochastic process coupled to atmospheric circulation. Rainfall is linked to the circulation patterns using conditional model parameters. Any kind of circulation pattern classification can be used for this purpose. In this study a new fuzzy rule based method of circulation patterns classification was used, The advantage of this classification technique is the fact that in contrast to common circulation patterns classifications its objective is to explain the variability of local precipitation. It means that the circulation patterns explain the relation between large-scale atmospheric circulation and surface climate (precipitation). Therefore the circulation patterns obtained by this classification method are suitable as input for the subsequent precipitation downscaling. The model was successfully applied in two regions with different climate conditions: Central Europe (Germany) and Eastern Mediterranean (Greece). Several tests like comparison of mean seasonal cycles, comparison of mean values and deviations of yearly totals and other standard diagnostics showed that simulated values agree fairly well with historical data.

	abstract = {The highly variable timing of streamflow in snowmelt-dominated basins across western North America is an important consequence, and indicator, of climate fluctuations. Changes in the timing of snowmelt-derived streamflow from 1948 to 2002 were investigated in a network of 302 western North America gauges by examining the center of mass for flow, spring pulse onset dates, and seasonal fractional flows through trend and principal component analyses. Statistical analysis of the streamflow timing measures with Pacific climate indicators identified local and key large-scale processes that govern the regionally coherent parts of the changes and their relative importance.
Widespread and regionally coherent trends toward earlier onsets of springtime snowmelt and streamflow have taken place across most of western North America, affecting an area that is much larger than previously recognized. These timing changes have resulted in increasing fractions of annual flow occurring earlier in the water year by 1-4 weeks. The immediate (or proximal) forcings for the spatially coherent parts of the year-to-year fluctuations and longer-term trends of streamflow timing have been higher winter and spring temperatures. Although these temperature changes are partly controlled by the decadal-scale Pacific climate mode [Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)], a separate ani significant part of the variance is associated with a springtime warming trend that spans the PDO phases.},

	abstract = {Spring snowmelt is the most important contribution of many rivers in western North America. If climate changes, this contribution may change. A shift in the timing of springtime snowmelt towards earlier in the year already is observed during 1948 - 2000 in many western rivers. Streamflow timing changes for the 1995 - 2099 period are projected using regression relations between observed streamflow-timing responses in each river, measured by the temporal centroid of streamflow (CT) each year, and local temperature (TI) and precipitation ( PI) indices. Under 21st century warming trends predicted by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) under business-as-usual greenhouse-gas emissions, streamflow timing trends across much of western North America suggest even earlier springtime snowmelt than observed to date. Projected CT changes are consistent with observed rates and directions of change during the past five decades, and are strongest in the Pacific Northwest, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, where many rivers eventually run 30 - 40 days earlier. The modest PI changes projected by PCM yield minimal CT changes. The responses of CT to the simultaneous effects of projected TI and PI trends are dominated by the TI changes. Regression-based CT projections agree with those from physically-based simulations of rivers in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada.},

	abstract = {An analysis is presented of an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) experiments from the ENSEMBLES project in terms of mean winter snow water equivalent (SWE), the seasonal evolution of snow cover, and the duration of the continuous snow cover season in the European Alps. Two sets of simulations are considered, one driven by GCMs assuming the SRES A1B greenhouse gas scenario for the period 1951–2099, and the other by the ERA-40 reanalysis for the recent past. The simulated SWE for Switzerland for the winters 1971–2000 is validated against an observational data set derived from daily snow depth measurements. Model validation shows that the RCMs are capable of simulating the general spatial and seasonal variability of Alpine snow cover, but generally underestimate snow at elevations below 1,000 m and overestimate snow above 1,500 m. Model biases in snow cover can partly be related to biases in the atmospheric forcing. The analysis of climate projections for the twenty first century reveals high inter-model agreement on the following points: The strongest relative reduction in winter mean SWE is found below 1,500 m, amounting to 40–80 \% by mid century relative to 1971–2000 and depending upon the model considered. At these elevations, mean winter temperatures are close to the melting point. At higher elevations the decrease of mean winter SWE is less pronounced but still a robust feature. For instance, at elevations of 2,000–2,500 m, SWE reductions amount to 10–60 \% by mid century and to 30–80 \% by the end of the century. The duration of the continuous snow cover season shows an asymmetric reduction with strongest shortening in springtime when ablation is the dominant factor for changes in SWE. We also find a substantial ensemble-mean reduction of snow reliability relevant to winter tourism at elevations below about 1,800 m by mid century, and at elevations below about 2,000 m by the end of the century.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {For the purposes of estimating local changes in surface climate at selected stations in the central Argentina region, induced by an enhanced CO, concentration, projected by general circulation models (GCM), a statistical method to derive local scale monthly mean minimum, maximum and mean temperatures from large-scale atmospheric predictors is presented. Empirical relationships are derived among selected variables from the NCEP re-analyses and local data for summer and winter months, tested against an independent set of observed data and subsequently applied to the MADAM and MPI GCM control runs. Finally, the statistical approach is applied to a climate change experiment performed with the MPI model to construct a local climate change scenario. The comparison between the estimated versus the observed mean temperature fields shows good agreement and the temporal evolution of the estimated variables is well-captured, though, the estimated temperatures contain less interannual variability than the observations. For the present day climate simulation, the results from the HADAM and MPI GCMs are used. It is shown that the pattern of estimated temperatures obtained using the MPI large-scale predictors matches the observations for summer months, though minimum and mean temperatures are slightly underestimated in the southeast part of the domain. However, the differences are well within the range of the observed variability. The possible anthropogenic climate change at the local scale is assessed by applying the statistical method to the results of the perturbed run conducted with the MPI model. For summer and winter months, the local temperature increase is smaller for minimum temperature than for maximum temperature for almost all the stations, yielding an enhanced temperature amplitude in both seasons. The temperature amplitude (difference between maximum and minimum) for summer months was larger than for winter months. The estimated maximum temperature increase is found to be larger for summer months than for winter months for all the stations, while for the minimum, temperature increases for summer and winter months are similar.

We find statistically significant responses by mean annual and monthly temperature, precipitation, and snow to CO2 doubling. Relative to the 280 ppm results, 560 ppm results show temperature increasing everywhere in the region annually (up to 3.8degreesC), and in every month, with the greatest monthly surface warming at high elevations.

However, different models differ substantially in their projections, which raises the question of how the different models can best be combined into a probability distribution of future climate change. For this analysis, we have collected both Current and future projected mean temperatures produced by nine climate models for 22 regions of the earth. We also have estimates of current mean temperatures from actual observations, together with standard errors, that can be used to calibrate the climate models. We propose a Bayesian analysis that allows us to combine the different climate models into a posterior distribution of future temperature increase, for each of the 22 regions, while allowing for the different climate models to have different variances. Two versions of the analysis are proposed: a univariate analysis in which each region is analyzed separately, and a multivariate analysis in which the 22 regions are combined into an overall statistical model. A cross-validation approach is proposed to confirm the reasonableness of our Bayesian predictive distributions. The results, of this analysis allow for a quantification of the uncertainty of climate model projections as a Bayesian posterior distribution, substantially extending previous approaches to uncertainty in climate models.},

	abstract = {Using a regional climate model (RegCM2.5), the potential impacts on the climate of California of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations were explored from the perspective of the state's 10 hydrologic regions. Relative to preindustrial CO2 conditions (280 ppm), doubled preindustrial CO2 conditions (560 ppm) produced increased temperatures of up to VC on an annual average basis and of up to 5degreesC on a monthly basis. Temperature increases were greatest in the central and northern regions. On a monthly basis, the temperature response was greatest in February, March, and May for nearly all regions. Snow accumulation was significantly decreased in all months and regions, with the greatest reduction occurring in the Sacramento River region. Precipitation results indicate drier winters for all regions, with a large reduction in precipitation from December to April and a smaller decrease from May to November. The result is a wet season that is slightly reduced in length. Findings suggest that the total amount of water in the state will decrease, water needs will increase, and the timing of water availability will be greatly perturbed.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe formulation of a fully compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheric model called the Model for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A) is described. The solver is discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates a split-explicit time-integration technique used in many existing nonhydrostatic meso- and cloud-scale models. MPAS can be applied to the globe, over limited areas of the globe, and on Cartesian planes. The Voronoi meshes are unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be used for regional NWP and regional climate applications. The rationales for aspects of this formulation are discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows on Cartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems in the mesh-transition zones.},

	abstract = {Historical observations indicate a shift toward shorter winters and increased average air temperatures in the midwestern United States. Furthermore, a rise in soil temperatures is likely to be enhanced under projections of increased air temperature; however, reduced snow cover during winter may lead to colder soil temperatures in the future. Cumulatively, these changes will affect cold season processes in the region. Therefore the impact of such changes on cold season processes were analyzed under two climate models (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory version CM2.1.1 (GFDL) and UK Met Office Hadley Center Climate Model, version 3.1 (HadCM3)) and three scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2) by implementing the variable infiltration capacity land surface model from 1977 to 2099. Ensemble averages of the two models for the three scenarios indicated that both air temperature and precipitation would increase in the cold season (December\&\#8211;May), with the greatest increases projected under the A2 scenario by late in the 21st century (2070\&\#8211;2099). Also during this period, the median number of days when air temperature was below 0°C reduced in comparison to the base period (1977\&\#8211;2006) by 25, 35, and 38 days for the B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios, respectively. The number of freeze-thaw cycles increased in the south-central Wisconsin and the northern regions of Michigan by up to 3 cycles, while the duration of soil frost decreased by between 2 weeks and nearly 2 months during 2070\&\#8211;2099 with respect to the base period.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Hydrologic model calibration is usually a central element of streamflow forecasting based on the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) method. Evaluation measures of forecast errors such as root-mean-square error (RMSE) are heavily influenced by bias, which in turn is readily reduced by calibration. On the other hand, bias can also be reduced by postprocessing (e.g., \&\#8220;training\&\#8221; bias correction schemes based on retrospective simulation error statistics). This observation invites the question: How much is forecast error reduced by calibration, beyond what can be accomplished by postprocessing to remove bias? The authors address this question through retrospective evaluation of forecast errors at eight streamflow forecast locations distributed across the western United States. Forecast periods of length ranging from 1 to 6 months are investigated, for forecasts initiated from 1 December to 1 June, which span the period when most runoff occurs from snowmelt-dominated western U.S. rivers. ESP forecast errors are evaluated both for uncalibrated forecasts to which a percentile mapping bias correction approach is applied, and for forecasts from an objectively calibrated model without explicit bias correction. Using the coefficient of prediction (Cp), which essentially is a measure of the fraction of variance explained by the forecast, the authors find that the reduction in forecast error as measured by Cp that is achieved by bias correction alone is nearly as great as that resulting from hydrologic model calibration.},

	abstract = {Drought is expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future as a result of climate change, mainly as a consequence of decreases in regional precipitation but also because of increasing evaporation driven by global warming. Previous assessments of historic changes in drought over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries indicate that this may already be happening globally. In particular, calculations of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) show a decrease in moisture globally since the 1970s with a commensurate increase in the area in drought that is attributed, in part, to global warming. The simplicity of the PDSI, which is calculated from a simple water-balance model forced by monthly precipitation and temperature data, makes it an attractive tool in large-scale drought assessments, but may give biased results in the context of climate change. Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years. The results have implications for how we interpret the impact of global warming on the hydrological cycle and its extremes, and may help to explain why palaeoclimate drought reconstructions based on tree-ring data diverge from the PDSI-based drought record in recent years.},

Overall, the multimodel ensemble does reasonably well at reproducing observed variability in several aspects, but it does less well at capturing observed teleconnections, with implications for future projections examined in part three of this paper. In terms of intraseasonal variability, almost half of the models examined can reproduce observed variability in the eastern Pacific and most models capture the midsummer drought over Central America. The multimodel mean replicates the density of traveling tropical synoptic-scale disturbances but with large spread among the models. On the other hand, the coarse resolution of the models means that tropical cyclone frequencies are underpredicted in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific. The frequency and mean amplitude of ENSO are generally well reproduced, although teleconnections with North American climate are widely varying among models and only a few models can reproduce the east and central Pacific types of ENSO and connections with U.S. winter temperatures. The models capture the spatial pattern of Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) variability and its influence on continental temperature and West Coast precipitation but less well for the wintertime precipitation. The spatial representation of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is reasonable, but the magnitude of SST anomalies and teleconnections are poorly reproduced. Multidecadal trends such as the warming hole over the central?southeastern United States and precipitation increases are not replicated by the models, suggesting that observed changes are linked to natural variability.},

	abstract = {This study develops a downscaling methodology for establishing relationships between Cape Town's winter synoptic scale circulation and temperature inversions in the boundary layer Application lion of the method is demonstrated by deriving inversion frequencies from general circulation model (GCM) data sets. Daily midday radiosonde data at Cape Town International airport for the winter of 1989 were classified in a binary manner for the identification of temperature inversions, and an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to relate sea-level pressure fields over Cape Town to local inversion conditions. ANNs were used to derive the relationships because of their robustness in the presence of noise and because they, do not have the constraints of linearity. These relationships were then applied to the simulations generated by two GCMs, the GISS and GENESIS models, in order to investigate their ability to represent the synoptic controls on local inversions. The two GCMs compared favourably with each other and were reasonably similar to the NMC's observational data regarding the number of temperature inversions each reflected. Following this, circulation for a simulation of doubled atmospheric CO2 was used to predict possible future changes in the frequency of inversions over Cape Town. The occurrence of temperature inversions increased by approximately 25\% using the GISS model and by 33\% using GENESIS. This putative increase in inversion frequency as a result of global climate change could have implications for the city's atmospheric pollution.},

A monthly drought index based on percentile soil moisture values relative to the 50-year climatology is analyzed in terms of duration, intensity and severity at global and regional scales. Short-term droughts (\&lt;= 6 months) are prevalent in the Tropics and midlatitudes, where inter-annual climate variability is highest. Medium term droughts (7\&\#8211;12 months) are more frequent in mid- to high-latitudes. Long term (12+ months) droughts are generally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa and higher northern latitudes. The Sahel region stands out for having experienced long-term and severe drought conditions. Severe regional drought events are systematically identified in terms of spatial coverage, based on different thresholds of duration and intensity. For example, in northern Europe, 1996 and 1975 were the years of most extensive 3- and 12-month duration drought, respectively. In northern Asia, severe drought events are characterized by persistent soil moisture anomalies over the wintertime. The drought index identifies several well-known events, including the 1988 US, 1982/83 Australian, 1983/4 Sahel and 1965/66 Indian droughts which are generally ranked as the severest and most spatially extensive in the record. Comparison with the PDSI shows general agreement at global scales and for these major events but they diverge considerably in cooler regions and seasons, and especially in latter years when the PDSI shows a larger drying trend.},

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {The winter tourism industry has been repeatedly identified as potentially vulnerable to global climate change. Climate change impact assessments of ski areas in Australia, Europe and North America all project negative consequences for the industry. An important limitation of earlier studies has been the incomplete consideration of snowmaking as a climate adaptation strategy. Recognising that snowmaking is an integral component of the ski industry, this study examined how current and improved snowmaking capacity affects the vulnerability of the ski industry in southern Ontario (Canada) to climate variability and change. A 17 yr record of daily snow conditions and operations from a primary ski area in the region was used to calibrate a ski season simulation model that included a snowmaking module with climatic thresholds and operational decision rules based on interviews with ski area managers. Climate change scenarios (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) were developed by downscaling climate variables from 4 general circulation models (using both IS92a and SIZES emission scenarios) with the LARS weather generator (parameterized to local climate stations) for input into a daily snow depth simulation model. In contrast to earlier studies, the results indicate that ski areas in the region could remain operational in a warmer climate, particularly within existing business planning and investment time horizons (into the 2020s), The economic impact of additional snowmaking requirements remains an important uncertainty. Under climate change scenarios and current snowmaking technology, the average ski season at the case study ski area was projected to reduce by 0-16 \% in the 2020s, 7-32 \% in the 2050s and 11-50 \% in the 2080s. Concurrent with the projected ski season losses, the estimated amount of snowmaking required increased by 36-144 \% in the scenarios for the 2020s. Required snowmaking amounts increased by 48-187 \% in the scenarios for the 2020s. The ability of individual ski areas to absorb additional snowmaking costs and remain economically viable in addition to the relative impact of climate change on other nearby ski regions (Quebec, Michigan and Vermont) remain important avenues of further research. The findings reveal the importance of examining a wide range of climate change scenarios and the necessity of including snowmaking and other adaptation strategies in future climate change vulnerability assessments of the ski industry and winter tourism in other regions of the world.},

Under a “business as usual” forcing scenario (RCP8.5), warming leads to a shift toward much earlier snowmelt-driven surface runoff in 2091–2100 compared to 1991–2000, with advances of as much as 80 days projected in the 35-model ensemble mean. For a realistic “mitigation” scenario (RCP4.5), the ensemble-mean change is smaller but still large (up to 30 days). For all plausible forcing scenarios and all GCMs, the simulated changes are statistically significant, so that a detectable change in runoff timing is inevitable. Even for the mitigation scenario, the ensemble-mean change is approximately equivalent to one standard deviation of the natural variability at most elevations. Thus, even when greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed, the runoff change is climatically significant. For the business-as-usual scenario, the ensemble-mean change is approximately two standard deviations of the natural variability at most elevations, portending a truly dramatic change in surface hydrology by the century’s end if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.},

	abstract = {Climate change scenarios with a high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural potential and agricultural risk. Such scenarios should reproduce changes in mean weather characteristics as well as incorporate the changes in climate variability indicated by the global climate model (GCM) used. Recent work on the sensitivity of crop models and climatic extremes has clearly demonstrated that changes in variability can have more profound effects on crop yield and on the probability of extreme weather events than simple changes in the mean values. The construction of climate change scenarios based on spatial regression downscaling and on the use of a local stochastic weather generator is described. Regression downscaling translated the coarse resolution GCM grid-box predictions of climate change to site-specific values. These values were then used to perturb the parameters of the stochastic weather generator in order to simulate site-specific daily weather data. This approach permits the incorporation of changes in the mean and variability of climate in a consistent and computationally inexpensive way. The stochastic weather generator used in this study, LARS-WG, has been validated across Europe and has been shown to perform well in the simulation of different weather statistics, including those climatic extremes relevant to agriculture. The importance of downscaling and the incorporation of climate variability are demonstrated at two European sites where climate change scenarios were constructed using the UK Met.

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Climate impact studies crucially rely on climate change information at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Since the most developed tools for estimating future climate change-the general circulation models (GCMs)-still operate on rather coarse spatial scales, their output has to be downscaled in order to provide the needed high resolution input for climate impact models. In this study, a perfect prognosis approach is employed to downscale daily local temperature extremes at several stations in south-eastern Australia from synoptic scale atmospheric circulation fields. The statistical model combines principal component analysis and linear multiple regression and is suitable to explain a considerable part of both short and long frequency variations of local temperature extremes. Using simulated and observed daily data the regional to local performance of the Mark2 GCM, developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), was validated over the Australian region. While the regional temperature extremes simulated under present-day climate conditions are in general agreement with the observed climate, there are highly significant differences on the local scale. The observed daily synoptic scale atmospheric circulation, however, is well reproduced by the GCM. This supports the idea of using these reliably simulated climatic parameters to estimate the changes in local temperature extremes under altered global climate conditions. The downscaling model was applied to synoptic scale atmospheric circulation fields generated by the CSIRO Mark2 GCM under 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 conditions. Compared to the extreme temperature changes simulated by the GCM directly, the downscaled variations are much weaker. Several sources of uncertainty might be causing these differences. Firstly, the statistical model is stationary. Therefore, it is not capable of including changes in the relationships between circulation and local temperature which are likely to occur under 2 x CO2 climate changes. It also only captures circulation-related temperature variations. An analysis of the circulation changes under 2 x CO2, however, reveals almost no significant differences to the present day conditions. That leads to the conclusion, that the quite dramatic changes of local temperature extremes under doubled CO2 are not driven by circulation changes and might be: almost solely caused by changed radiative properties of the atmosphere.

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {A comparison of two statistical downscaling methods for daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature, total daily precipitation and total monthly precipitation at Indianapolis, IN, USA, is presented. The analysis is conducted for two seasons, the growing season and the non-growing season, defined based on variability of surface air temperature. The predictors used in the downscaling are indices of the synoptic scale circulation derived from rotated principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis of variables extracted from an 18- year record from seven rawinsonde stations in the Midwest region of the United States. PCA yielded seven significant components for the growing season and five significant components for the non-growing season. These PCs explained 86\% and 83\% of the original rawinsonde data for the growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. Cluster analysis of the PC scores using the average linkage method resulted in eight growing season synoptic types and twelve non-growing synoptic types. The downscaling of temperature and precipitation is conducted using PC scores and cluster frequencies in regression models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Regression models and ANNs yielded similar results, but the data for each regression model violated at least one of the assumptions of regression analysis. As expected, the accuracy of the downscaling models for temperature was superior to that for precipitation. The accuracy of all temperature models was improved by adding an autoregressive term, which also changed the relative importance of the dominant anomaly patterns as manifest in the PC scores. Application of the transfer functions to model daily maximum and minimum temperature data from an independent time series resulted in correlation coefficients of 0.34-0.89. In accord with previous studies, the precipitation models exhibited lesser predictive capabilities. The correlation coefficient for predicted versus observed daily precipitation totals was less than 0.5 for both seasons, while that for monthly total precipitation was below 0.65. The downscaling techniques are discussed in terms of model performance, comparison of techniques and possible model improvements. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	title = {A case study of statistical downscaling in {Australia} using weather classification by recursive partitioning},
	volume = {213},
	abstract = {Because of their coarse resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs) lack the ability to predict reliably surface variables that may be needed for climate effects studies on a regional scale. Stochastic downscaling methods, based on the relationship between large-scale circulation types and regional surface variables, offer one approach to bridge this scale mismatch. The method explored in this paper uses recursive partitioning (also known as Classification Tree Analysis) to identify circulation patterns (weather states) in observed sea level pressure (SLP) fields that are most closely related to certain rainfall occurrence patterns (dry/wet) at multiple stations. The joint distribution functions of rainfall amounts at a set of stations are then used to define a statistical model for rainfall conditional on these weather states and the previous day's rainfall occurrence/absence. This model is applied to SLP fields from control, 2 x CO2 equilibrium and transient 100 year GCM integrations performed at the Max- Planck-Institut fur Meteorologie, Hamburg to simulate local rainfall corresponding to the large-scale GCM climates. The weather generator is applied for several case studies in Australia. Four regions, one each in the West, the North, the Southeast and East of Australia are considered, for the summer and winter seasons, respectively. These regions correspond to different climate zones: the North has mainly summer monsoon rain, the West has dominant frontal winter rainfall, and moderate Southeast has a relatively uniform rainfall distribution throughout the year. Thus, the performance of the weather generator in different climatic regimes can be evaluated. Since rainfall amounts are simulated by sampling from historical data a statistical uncertainty is attached to the generated rainfall sequences which is due to the procedure used. This is reflected in uncertainties of the downscaled mean rainfall of generally less than +/- 10\%, with larger numerical intervals for dry stations and seasons. The effects of a 2 x CO2 signal in the equilibrium run on local rainfall are not dramatic. For the transient experiment there is an indication of more rainy days and a decrease in the length of dry periods in West Australia in winter. The strongest change is identified in the North in the monsoon season which would have decreasing rainfall. No unequivocal changes were found for the Southeast. However, consistent with earlier studies, the bias of GCM control simulations strongly affects the results, as the difference between precipitation statistics based on observed and control run pressure fields often exceeds the difference between GCM control and altered climate. Considering this deficiency in current GCM simulations, the disagreement between different climate models and the uncertainty attached to the statistical downscaling method, not too much reliance can be put on the relevance of these results for regional hydrologic impact modeling.

This is considered to be one step towards downscaling coarsely gridded climate data from global climate models (GCMs) to finer spatial scales. Downscaling is necessary in order to bridge the spatial mismatch between GCMs and climate impact models which need information on spatial scales that the GCMs cannot provide. The method of statistical downscaling is based on physical interaction between atmospheric processes with different spatial scales, in this case between synoptic scale mean sea level pressure (MSLP) fields and local temperature extremes at several stations in southeast Australia. In this study it was found that most of the day-to-day spatial variability of the synoptic circulation over the Australian region can be captured by six principal components. Using the scores of these PCs as multivariate indicators of the circulation a substantial part of the local daily temperature variability could be explained. The inclusion of temperature persistence noticeably improved the performance of the statistical model. The model established and tested with observations is thought to be finally applied to GCM-simulated pressure fields in order to estimate pressure- related changes in local temperature extremes under altered CO2 conditions.},

This study evaluates the performance of bias correction methods using natural variability as a baseline. This baseline implies that any bias between model simulations and observations is only significant if it is larger than the natural climate variability. Four bias correction methods are evaluated with respect to reproducing a set of climatic and hydrological statistics. When using natural variability as a baseline, complex bias correction methods still outperform the simplest ones for precipitation and temperature time series, although the differences are much smaller than in all previous studies. However, after driving a hydrological model using the bias-corrected precipitation and temperature, all bias correction methods perform similarly with respect to reproducing 46 hydrological metrics over two watersheds in different climatic zones. The sophisticated distribution mapping correction methods show little advantage over the simplest scaling method. The main conclusion is that simple bias correction methods appear to be just as good as other more complex methods for hydrological climate change impact studies. While sophisticated methods may appear more theoretically sound, this additional complexity appears to be unjustified in hydrological impact studies when taking into account the uncertainty linked to natural climate variability.},

We find that the choice of different decadal periods over which to derive the bias correction parameters is a source of comparatively minor uncertainty, while other sources play larger and similarly significant roles.

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {Statistical downscaling of general circulation models (GCMs) and limited area models (LAMs) has been promoted as a method for simulating regional- to point-scale precipitation under changed climate conditions. However, several studies have shown that downscaled precipitation is either insensitive to changes in climatic forcing, or inconsistent with the broad-scale changes indicated by the host GCM(s). This has been recently attributed to the omission of the effect that changes in atmospheric moisture content have on precipitation. We describe validation of a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) for changed climate conditions and apply it to a network of 30 daily precipitation stations in southwestern Australia. NHMMs fitted to 1 x CO2 LAM data were validated by assessing their performance in predicting 2 x CO2 LAM precipitation. The inclusion of 850 hPa dew point temperature depression, a predictor reflecting relative (rather than absolute) atmospheric moisture content, was found to be crucial to successful performance of the NHMM under 2 x CO2 conditions. The NHMM validated for the LAM data was fitted to the historical 30 station network and then used to downscale the 2 x CO2 LAM atmospheric data, producing plausible predictions of station precipitation under 2 x CO2 conditions. Our results highlight that the validation of a statistical downscaling technique for present day conditions does not necessarily imply legitimacy for changed climate conditions. Thus statistical downscaling studies that have not attempted to determine the plausibility of their predictions for the changed climate conditions should be viewed with caution.},

	volume = {58},
	abstract = {Recent studies of trends in Midwestern precipitation show marked increases over the last 50 years of the 20th Century, and most climate models project that future rainfall in the Corn Belt will be increased further. During five years, 1988- 1991 and 1994, field tests were conducted on agricultural test plots in central Illinois, an area typical of the Corn Belt, to discern how corn yields reacted to varying levels of added rainfall (+10\%, +25\%, and +40\%) during the growing season. The best treatment over the five years was a 40\% rain increase, with an average yield increase of 9\%. Its yield increase was up to 34\% in a hot-dry year, but below that of natural rainfall in a wet year as were the yields of the other lesser increases. The average yield changes from the three treatments were not statistically significantly different. Major interannual yield differences were found in the yields for each rain treatment, reflecting how rain timing and temperatures also have major effects on yields. A 40\% summer rain increase has little influence if natural rains do not occur in the high stress period of mid summer. The plots results show that only small average increases in corn yields occur from growing season rain additions in the 10\% to 40\% range, except in dry years. Weather-crop yield regression models incorporating the same rain increases predict greater yield increases than found in these field tests. This suggests that future yields projected for a wetter climate using yield-weather models may be over- estimated. The plot sample size is small but conditions sampled in the five years represented 43\% of all past 97 growing seasons in central Illinois and extremely good and bad weather years, which resulted in large between-year yield differences. Hence, the experimental results provide useful information about how increased rainfall may affect future corn yields, especially since the sample included three of the five types of dry growing seasons found in the area's climate since 1900.},

This bias is caused by the mismatch of the regional and the driving global models' physical parameterizations. It is suggested that simulations at spatial resolution similar to the driving global model should be used to estimate the possible bias in the higher resolution simulations. This correction is shown for a climate downscaling experiment over Southeast Asia. The global model is the NCAR community climate model (CCM3), and the regional model is the regional spectral model (RSM) of NCEP. The bias is estimated by taking the difference between a RSM0 (RSM run with similar CCM3 resolution) and the CCM3 solution. Once this bias is removed, the resulting seasonal-mean at higher resolution simulation shows a large-scale pattern more similar to that of the driving CCM3, but still retains additional realistic regional details.},

	abstract = {A statistical analysis of the seasonal and interannual variations in the regional temperature anomalies of Sweden during 1861-1994 is performed. The study uses homogenized monthly temperatures averaged over 6 regions to minimize the non-climatic and local-scale climatic effects. It is found that the temperature variability shows a clear regional and seasonal dependency. The topography, the influence of the sea acid the synoptic climatology may have determined the dependency. The anomaly is related to variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) expressed by an index (NAOI) and the extent to which the temperature anomaly can be explained by the NAO is investigated. The results show that the NAO has an important effect on the regional Swedish temperature on the monthly and interannual scales. The relationship between the temperature and NAOI over the period 1985-1994 are strong, implying that the NAOI may be a suitable candidate for a statistical downscaling model of the regional temperature. However, correlation analysis over different 31-year periods shows that the strength of the association varies with time and region. The further north the weaker the association. On the other hand, the temporal variations of the moving correlations for the 6 regions are similar. Part of the temporal variations may be explained by the averaged strength of NAO during different 31-year periods. This is especially evident for southern Sweden. At last, the coherency spectrums between the temperature anomalies acid the NAO index is determined, which enables an examination of the association over the frequency domain. The result supports the idea that the NAO has an important effect on the Swedish temperature, though the strength of the association varied with rime. These results have implications for statistical downscaling.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The severe impacts of climate variability and climate hazards on society reveal the increasing need for improving regional and local-scale climate diagnosis. A new downscaling approach for climate diagnosis is presented here. It is based on artificial neural network (ANN) techniques that derive relationships from the large-and local-scale atmospheric controls to the local winter climate. This study documents the large-scale conditions associated with extreme precipitation events in northeastern Mexico and southeastern Texas during the 1985-93 period, and demonstrates the ability of ANN to simulate realistic relationships between circularion-humidity fields and daily precipitation at local scale. The diagnostic model employs a neural network that preclassifies the winter circulation and humidity fields into different patterns. The results from this neural network classification approach, known as a self-organizing map (SOM), indicate that negative (positive) anomalies of winter precipitation over the study area are associated with 1) a weaker (stronger) Aleutian low, 2) a stronger (weaker) North Pacific high, 3) a negative (positive) phase of the Pacific-North American pattern, and 4) cold (warm) ENSO events. The atmospheric patterns classified with the SOM technique are then used as input to another neural network (feed-forward ANN) that captures over 60\% of the daily rainfall variance over the region. This further reveals that the SOM preclassification of days with similar atmospheric conditions succeeded in emphasizing the differences of the atmospheric variance that are conducive to extreme precipitation. This resulted in a downscaling model that is highly sensitive to local- and large-scale weather anomalies associated with ENSO warm events and cold air outbreaks.},

	abstract = {The large-scale atmospheric controls on winter rainfall variability for north-eastern Mexico and south-eastern Texas are diagnosed based on 8 years (1985-1993) of daily data from the Goddard Space Flight Center four-dimensional data assimilation scheme. Downscaling techniques based on artificial neural nets are used to derive transfer functions from the large-scale circulation to local precipitation. Daily rainfall amounts are predicted from synoptic sea-level pressure, 500 hPa heights, and the 100-500 hPa thickness, and summed over the cool season (NDJF). The monthly rainfall totals are also predicted independently from other indices of the large-scale circulation, such as 100-500 hPa thickness, the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern, and a standardized Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) derived from the Tahiti minus Darwin sea-level pressure difference. Time-lagged component scores from a rotated principal component analysis of sea-level pressure, 500 hPa heights, and 100-500 hPa thickness serve as input to a neural net that produces time-series of daily rainfall amounts for 20 grid-points in the study area. The correlation between the observed and predicted rainfall is greater than 0.7 in the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and less than 0.7 over the Sierra Madre and the Gulf, suggesting an increase in the importance of local rainfall processes in the last two regions. The analysis shows a systematic relationship between the performance of the net and physiography, which is confirmed by the consistency of the patterns of spatial correlation, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error at different time- scales. The net captures the phase and amplitude of most of the rainfall events, reflecting the influence of the large-scale circulation. However, interannual fluctuations in rainfall associated with persistent El Nino conditions are partly bypassed by the net, suggesting that more information is needed to predict extreme events. The PNA pattern does not seem to be associated with local rainfall in north-eastern Mexico and south-eastern Texas during the period analysed. (C) 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society.},

However, predictions of these changes are uncertain. In the absence of single, firm predictions, the next best approach is to identify sets of plausible future conditions termed scenarios. This paper focuses on the development of climate change scenarios for northern high latitude regions. Three methods of scenario development can be identified: use of analogues having conditions similar to those expected in the study region, application of general circulation me del results, and composite methods that combine information from different sources. A composite approach has been used to produce scenarios of temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide and sea-level change for Finland up to 2100, as part of the Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change (SILMU). Tools for applying these scenarios in impact assessment studies, including stochastic weather generators and spatial downscaling techniques, are also examined. The SILMU scenarios attempt to capture uncertainties both in future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere and in the global climate response to these emissions. Two types of scenario were developed: (i) simple ''policy-oriented'' scenarios and (ii) detailed ''scientific'' scenarios. These are compared with new model estimates of future climate and recent observed changes in climate over certain high latitude regions.},

In the current study. the ability of empirical downscaling models to resolve these changes is investigated using ensemble neural networks forced with synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions. Five-day averages of streamflow data from 21 watersheds in the region are modelled using atmospheric data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project as inputs. Ability of the downscaling models to predict streamflow and changes in streamflow between 19751986 and 1987-1998 is evaluated using a combination of model performance statistics, comparisons between long-term averages, and results from non-parametric statistical tests. {\textbackslash} While performance varied between systems, results suggest that empirical downscaling models for streamflow are capable of predicting changes in streamflow observed during recent decades using only large-scale atmospheric conditions as model inputs. Based on comparisons between stepwise linear regression and neural network models. the latter approach is recommended, particularly when trying to model systems with complex non-linear and interactive relationships between inputs and outputs. The use of ensemble averaging as a part of the modelling process is investigated and a number of recommendations are made with respect to this methodology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {A form of sensitivity analysis is described that illustrates the effects that inputs have on outputs of statistical models. The strength and sign of relationships, the types of nonlinearity, and the presence of interactions between inputs can be diagnosed using this technique. Intended for interpreting flexible nonlinear models, the graphical sensitivity analysis is applied to artificial neural networks (ANNs) in this study. As ANNs are increasingly being used for climate prediction, the discussion focuses on specific problems associated with their use in this context. The technique is illustrated using a real-world, long-range climate prediction example. Principal components (PCs) of circulation fields prior to the Indian summer monsoon are related to rainfall during monsoon months for the 1958-98 period. The skill of multiple linear regression and ensemble ANNs are compared using a resampling procedure. Interpretation of the models is then conducted using traditional diagnostic tools and graphical sensitivity analysis. This provides an improved investigation of precursor circulation field-summer monsoon rainfall relationships identified in a previous modelling study. The relatively stable, linear relationship identified between the May 200 hPa geopotential height field and summer monsoon rainfall is confirmed. Correlations previously identified between 850 hPa geopotential heights during January and rainfall by ANNs are shown to be the result of a weakly nonlinear, interactive relationship involving the first and second PCs of this field. An analysis of out-of-sample model predictions suggests that this relationship does not persist over the entire study period. This may result from a modulation of the strength of the circulation-rainfall relationship by El Nino-southern oscillation. Stratification of the results also reveals a relatively strong, nearly linear relationship with monsoon strength during years exhibiting positive scores of the second PC. On extending the analysis to longer lead-times, the surface pressure and 850 hPa geopotential height fields during November show relatively strong, persistent precursor relationships with summer monsoon rainfall. Sensitivity analyses suggest a mildly nonlinear relationship that is common to both fields. Copyright (C) 2002 Environment Canada. Published by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

The case considered is regional seasonal precipitation in Romania. The downscaling model is a regression based on canonical correlation analysis between observed station precipitation and European-scale sea level pressure (SLP). The climate models considered here are the T21 and T42 versions of the Hamburg ECHAM3 atmospheric GCM run in "time-slice" mode. The climate change scenario refers to the expected time of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations around the year 2050. The downscaling model is skillful for all seasons except spring. The general features of the large-scale SLP variability are reproduced fairly well by both GCMs in all seasons. The climate models reproduce the empirically determined precipitation-SLP link in winter, whereas the observed link is only partially captured for the other seasons. Thus, these models may be considered skillful with respect to regional precipitation during winter, and partially during the other seasons. Generally, applications of statistical downscaling to climate change scenarios have been based on the assumption that the empirical link between the large-scale and regional parameters remains valid under a changed climate. In this study, a rationale is proposed for this assumption by showing the consistency of the 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios in winter, derived directly from the gridpoint data, with the regional scenarios obtained through empirical downscaling. Since the skill of the GCMs in regional terms is already established, it is concluded that the downscaling technique is adequate for describing climatically changing regional and local conditions, at least for precipitation in Romania during winter.},

	abstract = {This study deals with an analysis of the performance of a general circulation model (GCM) (HadCM2) in reproducing the large-scale circulation mechanisms controlling Swedish precipitation variability, and in estimating regional climate changes owing to increased CO2 concentration by using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Seasonal precipitation amounts at 33 stations in Sweden over the period 1899-1990 are used. The large-scale circulation is represented by sea level pressure (SLP) over the Atlantic-European region. The link between seasonal Swedish precipitation and large-scale SLP variability is strong in all seasons, but especially in winter and autumn. For these two seasons, the link is a consequence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern. In winter, another important mechanism is related to a cyclonic/anticyclonic structure centred over southern Scandinavia. In the past century, this connection has remained almost unchanged in time for all seasons except spring. The downscaling model that is built on the basis of this link is skilful in all seasons, but especially so in winter and autumn. This observed link is only partially reproduced by the HadCM2 model, while large-scale SLP variability is fairly well reproduced in all seasons. A concept about optimum statistical downscaling models for climate change purposes is proposed. The idea is related to the capability of the statistical downscaling model to reproduce low frequency variability, rather than having the highest skill in terms of explained variance. By using these downscaling models, it was found that grid point and downscaled climate signals are similar (increasing precipitation) in summer and autumn, while in winter, the amplitudes of the two signals are different. In spring, both signals show a slight increase in the northern and southern parts of Sweden. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Current climate change projections are based on comprehensive multi-model ensembles of global and regional climate simulations. Application of this information to impact studies requires a combined probabilistic estimate taking into account the different models and their performance under current climatic conditions. Here we present a Bayesian statistical model for the distribution of seasonal mean surface temperatures for control and scenario periods. The model combines observational data for the control period with the output of regional climate models (RCMs) driven by different global climate models (GCMs). The proposed Bayesian methodology addresses seasonal mean temperatures and considers both changes in mean temperature and interannual variability. In addition, unlike previous studies, our methodology explicitly considers model biases that are allowed to be time-dependent (i.e. change between control and scenario period). More specifically, the model considers additive and multiplicative model biases for each RCM and introduces two plausible assumptions ("constant bias'' and "constant relationship'') about extrapolating the biases from the control to the scenario period. The resulting identifiability problem is resolved by using informative priors for the bias changes. A sensitivity analysis illustrates the role of the informative prior. As an example, we present results for Alpine winter and summer temperatures for control (1961 1990) and scenario periods (2071-2100) under the SRES A2 greenhouse gas scenario. For winter, both bias assumptions yield a comparable mean warming of 3.5-3.6 degrees C. For summer, the two different assumptions have a strong influence on the probabilistic prediction of mean warming, which amounts to 5.4 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C for the "constant bias'' and "constant relation'' assumptions, respectively. Analysis shows that the underlying reason for this large uncertainty is due to the overestimation of summer interannual variability in all models considered. Our results show the necessity to consider potential bias changes when projecting climate under an emission scenario. Further work is needed to determine how bias information can be exploited for this task.},

	abstract = {A method is introduced by which the results of a regional climate model (RCM) that is temporarily nested in a general circulation model (GCM) are extrapolated in time. The procedure is based on a weather-type classification scheme using cluster analysis. It relies on statistical relationships between GCM and RCM output which are deduced from the overlapping nesting period. For a validation of the extrapolation scheme, a 30 yr GCM simulation of the Hadley Centre with a continuously nested RCM is used, The predictor is the large-scale 500 hPa geopotential height, and the predictands are the regional-scale surface temperature and precipitation. A comparison of the results of the extrapolation scheme with the direct RCM output for the winter temperature and precipitation in Central Europe demonstrates the potential of the method developed. Provided that results of a long-term GCM run are available and the statistics can be transferred from the overlapping period to the extrapolation period, the new method allows a reduction in the computational effort needed for long-term RCM simulations by shortening the integration time considerably.},

	abstract = {We report results of the project, European River Flood Occurrence and Total Risk Assessment System (EUROTAS), which was aimed at assessing the risk of current and future floodings for Europe, including the effects of climatic change. With respect to the latter, precipitation scenarios have been derived from a global climate model using the method of expanded downscaling (EDS), and regionalized for the catchment of the river Pinios (Greece). Jizera (Cechia), Saar (Germany), and Thames (UK). We present both the climate change information conveyed by the scenarios and an assessment about its statistical significance. For this report, all simulations were rerun using an improved EDS model version. Most notably, the inclusion of atmospheric humidity to the set of global predictor fields helped reducing the underlying uncertainty of the results. When driven by observed atmospheric fields (analyses), the EDS model performed in most cases satisfactorily, as it reproduced the larger precipitation clusters with good accuracy. To evaluate the precipitation scenarios, a statistical test was applied that compared what we defined as 'current climate' with the 'changed climate' of the scenario. To define current climate, local precipitation observations were used together with EDS regionalizations of the analyses and of a climate model control simulation. It turned out that in spite of the considerable uncertainty stemming from model errors and, more importantly, natural variability, a significant redistribution of rainfall is projected. Specifically, the scenarios show a decay of rainfall frequency for all catchments, which for Pinios leads to an overall negative water balance. This is accompanied, and for the other catchments outweighed, by a strong rainfall intensification. For the latter, we provide a more detailed extreme value analysis. We emphasize that the results should be interpreted with caution and not overemphasized quantitatively. Scenarios of precipitation are still of prototype nature and under steady development.

	abstract = {Long-term simulations of temporal rainfall and temperature under transient global climate conditions are discussed to give an insight into potential modifications of atmospheric inputs at the basin scale in the Arno River in central Italy. The outputs from a global circulation model (GCM), simulating climate changes due to an increase in the greenhouse effect resulting from a continuous trend in the growth of CO2 atmospheric concentration and accounting for the influence of both CO2 and sulphate aerosols, are downscaled using a stochastic approach based on the observed nonstationarity of precipitation and temperature patterns. By using the historical joint variability of the internal structure of storm events, one can infer future changes in storm duration and depth from GCM trend variables, thus indicating the extent of changes in the occurrence of wet and dry periods and in the daily rates, including those of distributional properties at the monthly and annual scales. Because the changes detected mainly affect the tails of the distributions, one can conclude that modifications can occur in both low and high values of rainfall at the monthly and annual scales, with a shift of the storm patterns towards shorter and more intense convective rainfall, especially in the summer season. Stochastic simulation also shows that the distributional and scaling properties of rainfall extremes may progressively change, thus indicating that some revision of current practices to estimate extreme storms is needed to account for possible effects of non- stationary climate conditions, This approach provides local precipitation that, together with temperature scenarios, can be used for hydrological simulation of basin water fluxes in the Arno River, as reported in a companion paper (Burlando P, Rosso R.

	abstract = {In an attempt to reconcile the capabilities of statistical downscaling and the demands of ecosystem modeling, the technique of expanded downscaling is introduced. Aimed at use in ecosystem models, emphasis is placed on the preservation of daily variability to the extent that possible climate change permits. Generally, the expansion is possible for any statistical model which is formulated by utilizing some form of regression, but I will concentrate on linear models as they are easier to handle. Linear statistical downscaling assumes that the local climate anomalies are linearly linked to the global circulation anomalies. In expanded downscaling, in contrast, I propose that the local climate covariance is linked bilinearly to the global circulation covariance. This is done by transforming the technique of unconstrained minimization of the error cost function into a constrained minimization problem, with the preservation of local covariance forming the side condition. A general normalization routine is included on the local side in order to perform the downscaling exclusively with normally distributed variables. Application of the expanded operator to the daily, global circulation works essentially like a weather generator. Using observed geopotential height fields over the North Atlantic and Europe gave consistent results for the weather station at Potsdam with 14 measured quantities, even for moisture-related variables. For GCM (general circulation model) scenarios, satisfactory results are obtained when the original variables are normally distributed. If they are not, strong sensitivity even to small input changes cause the normalization to produce large errors. Non-normally distributed variables such as most moisture variables are therefore strongly affected by even slight deficiencies of current GCMs with respect to daily variability and climatology. This marks the limit of applicability of expanded downscaling.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the influence of different climate scenarios on scenarios for the impact variable 'landslide activity'. For this purpose, a site-specific model was used, relating the activity of a landslide in South East France to climate. Landslide activity was reconstructed from tree ring data. Hydrological field data indicated that the controlling climatic variable is net precipitation (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). However, this variable and hence the impact model could not explain all of the variations in landslide activity. The landslide model was fed with 1 temperature and several precipitation scenarios obtained by applying 3 different methods for downscaling 3 different general circulation model (GCM) simulations of the large-scale climate. The skill of the downscaling methods in reproducing the historical local precipitation was either limited or trivial, but fair enough to justify further application. The resulting scenarios for landslide activity were quite similar, with the exception of 2 specific combinations of GCM and downscaling method. Furthermore, short- term climatic variation, plausibly represented in one of the downscaling methods as a random noise component, caused additional variation in the resulting scenarios. The amount of variation in the climate scenarios is of the same order of magnitude as that in the landslide model. The general conclusion is not to focus on calibrating impact models while using only 1 climate scenario, but to assess the overall uncertainty of the impact scenario by considering different parameter settings of the impact model as well as different climate scenarios, as was done in the present study.},

	abstract = {The association between daily as well as monthly winter precipitation and concurrent 700 hPa heights for 3 different North American precipitation regimes was examined using correlation fields and a typing of daily 700 hPa height patterns. Wet days, regardless of circulation type, were found to be associated with negative height anomalies immediately to the west or northwest of the precipitation regions, at the 'local' grid point. These small-scale height anomalies were found to represent traveling short waves that were missed by the circulation typing scheme, The correlation fields between monthly precipitation and concurrent 700 hPa heights revealed a westward shift of the height minima to a location west of 100degreesW, to a 'remote' grid point. The nature of these remote minima was examined using the 10 wettest and 10 driest months. Decomposition of the height anomalies at the remote grid points into between-type and within-type contributions revealed that while some of the negative heights during wet months are due to an increase in the frequency of circulation patterns with below normal heights (such as troughs or weak ridges), more than two-thirds of the contribution comes from height depressions superimposed upon the larger-scale patterns and most of these are associated with positive vorticity. This leads to the conclusion that the correlation minima west of 100degreesW at the monthly time scale reflect the frequent generation of short waves during wet months over the well-known North American cyclogenetic region east of the Rocky Mountains, These results have 2 implications with respect to statistical downscaling. First, regarding techniques designed to extract information from a single grid point: the optimum grid point location may be a function of the time scale under consideration, Second, regarding techniques designed to extract information from large-scale circulation patterns: the difficulties in capturing the very important but small short waves limit their usefulness.},

	abstract = {A climate change impacts assessment for water resources in the San Joaquin River region of California is presented. Regional climate projections are based on a 1 percent per year CO2 increase relative to late 20th Century CO2 conditions. Two global projections of this CO2 increase scenario are considered (HadCM2 and PCM) during two future periods (2010 to 2039 and 2050 to 2079). HadCM2 projects faster warming than PCM. HadCM2 and PCM project wetter and drier conditions, respectively, relative to present climate. In the HadCM2 case, there would be increased reservoir inflows, increased storage limited by existing capacity, and increased releases for deliveries and river flows. In the PCM case, there would be decreased reservoir inflows, decreased storage and releases, and decreased deliveries. Impacts under either projection case cannot be regarded as more likely than the other. Most of the impacts uncertainty is attributable to the divergence in the precipitation projections. The range of assessed impacts is too broad to guide selection of mitigation projects. Regional planning agencies can respond by developing contingency strategies for these cases and applying the methodology herein to evaluate a broader set Of CO2 scenarios, land use projections, and operational assumptions. Improved agency access to climate projection information is necessary to support this effort.},

	title = {Modification of a correlation-based circulation pattern classification to reduce within-type variability of temperature and precipitation},
	volume = {20},
	abstract = {When a correlation-based circulation pattern classification was applied to daily 700 hPa heights for 25 summer seasons, and the circulation types were related to surface temperature and precipitation for the Lake Superior basin, within-type variability was found to be high. Regarding temperature, the difference between warm and cold days of a type is a positive height anomaly centred to the east of the lake, which is very similar to the height anomaly for winter temperatures identified ill an earlier study. The difference between wet and dry days of a type is a pattern quite unlike that for temperature. It is a dipole pattern consisting of a negative anomaly to the northwest of the lake and a positive anomaly to the east and southeast. These small-scale circulation components were missed by the correlation-based classification because they are much smaller than the differences in height between circulation types. Regression models, relating monthly mean temperature anomalies to circulation type frequencies, produced results comparable to those obtained for winter temperature. For precipitation, the variance explained by the regression models is only half that obtained for temperature. Two approaches were used to reduce within-type variability and to improve the regression results: the division of the first few circulation types into warm/cold and wet/dry subtypes on the basis of differences in 700 hPa vorticity tan approach introduced in the earlier paper), and a modified correlation- based circulation pattern classification. The modification consisted of raising the correlation threshold for a few selected grid-points to capture the small-scale circulation component and also, of lowering the threshold for the comparison between maps and map sectors in order to minimize the number of unclassified days. Of the two approaches used to reduce within-type variability, the modified classification scheme produced superior results. In particular, the variance in precipitation explained by the regression models is about 30\% higher than that achieved using vorticity to create subtypes.

	abstract = {Unknowns in future global warming are usually assumed to arise from uncertainties either in the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or in the sensitivity of the climate to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Characterizing the additional uncertainty in relating CO 2 emissions to atmospheric concentrations has relied on either a small number of complex models with diversity in process representations, or simple models. To date, these models indicate that the relevant carbon cycle uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainties in physical climate feedbacks and emissions. Here, for a single emissions scenario, we use a full coupled climate–carbon cycle model and a systematic method to explore uncertainties in the land carbon cycle feedback. We find a plausible range of climate–carbon cycle feedbacks significantly larger than previously estimated. Indeed the range of CO 2 concentrations arising from our single emissions scenario is greater than that previously estimated across the full range of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios with carbon cycle uncertainties ignored. The sensitivity of photosynthetic metabolism to temperature emerges as the most important uncertainty. This highlights an aspect of current land carbon modelling where there are open questions about the potential role of plant acclimation to increasing temperatures. There is an urgent need for better understanding of plant photosynthetic responses to high temperature, as these responses are shown here to be key contributors to the magnitude of future change.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Extreme daily precipitation for the current and changed climate at appropriate spatial scales is assessed. This is done in the context of the impact of climate change on flooding in the river Meuse in Western Europe. The objective is achieved by determining and comparing extreme precipitation from stations, reanalysis projects, global climate models and regional climate models. An extreme value reduction methodoloy based on extreme precipitation correlation structure and surface area is used to deal with the transformation between different spatial scales. It appeared that return values are simulated quite well by the regional climate models and CSIRO9, but are underestimated by the reanalyses and overestimated by CGCM1 and HadCM3. The models simulated an average increase in extreme precipitation with climate change of about 18\%, which is in the same range as the average model error and intermodel differences. The appropriate spatial scale for representing extreme precipitation was estimated at 20 km, when the bias permitted in the estimation of extreme precipitation is set at 10\%. Downscaling modelled extreme precipitation to this appropriate scale results in considerable differences between reanalysis and GCM scale and appropriate scale return values. It is therefore obvious that return values at these appropriate scales should be used instead of at their original scales. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

While some modelled quantities respond almost immediately to the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, others exhibit a time lag relative to the change in CO 2 . Most quantities also exhibit a lag relative to the global-mean surface temperature change, which can be described as a hysteresis behaviour. The most surprising responses are from low-level clouds and ocean stratification in the Southern Ocean, which both exhibit hysteresis on timescales longer than expected. We see no evidence of critical thresholds in these simulations, although some of the hysteresis phenomena become more apparent above 2 × CO 2 or 3 × CO 2 . Our findings have implications for the parametrization of climate impacts in integrated assessment and simple climate models and for future climate studies of geoengineering scenarios.},

	volume = {57},
	abstract = {A semi-empirical downscaling approach is presented to estimate spatial and temporal statistical properties of local daily mean wind speed under global climate change. The present semi- empirical downscaling method consists of two elements. Since general circulation models (GCMs) are able to reproduce the features of the present atmospheric general circulation quite correctly, the first element represents the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. The second element is a link between local wind speed and large-scale circulation pattern (CP). The linkage is expressed by a stochastic model conditioned on CP types. Parameters of the linkage model are estimated using observed data series; then this model is utilized with GCM-generated CP type data corresponding to a 2 x CO2 scenario. Under the climate of Nebraska the lognormal distribution is the best two-parameter distribution to describe daily mean wind speed. The space-time variability of wind speed is described by a transformed multivariate autoregressive (AR) process, and the linkage between local wind and large-scale circulation is expressed as a conditional AR process, i.e. the autoregressive parameters depend on the actual daily CP type. The basic tendency of change under 2 x CO2 climate is a considerable increase of wind speed from the beginning of summer to the end of winter and a somewhat smaller wind decrease in spring.

	title = {The 500 and 1000 {hPa} weather type circulations and their relationship with some extreme climatic conditions over southern {South} {America}},
	volume = {23},
	abstract = {Different circulation types for southern South America are derived from the circulation anomaly maps at 500 hPa corresponding to a 9 year period. The series of daily maps was obtained from the ECWMF reanalysis. These data are particularly useful, since real data, especially the radiosonde network, are sparse in this region. The properties to be studied are selected in such a way that they describe different flow conditions over the region, in order to obtain a statistical diagnosis useful for modelling an objective forecast. The circulation types were obtained by a correlation-map-based pattern classification technique. Lund's method is used in this paper to identify the most frequent circulation patterns. The classification method was applied to daily Z anomalies at 500 hPa over the whole record (1980-88). This allows one to analyse the evolution and presence of a particular type over different months and years. The most outstanding circulation-type structures, represented by only eight types, explain about 63\% of the total number of cases in the sample. The most frequent type, Type 1 (Z), shows an almost zonal circulation with a strong meridional gradient, associated with a trough in the west of the region. Type 2 (LCE) is represented by a low- pressure system in the centre of the region (approximately at 37degreesS, 65degreesW). In general, this type is related to the occurrence of blocking situations in the South Atlantic Ocean and the passage of cold fronts over the region. Types 3 (SW) and 4 (WNW) show a SW and WNW atmospheric circulation over the whole region with a meridional gradient lower than in Type 1. Type 5 (TNS) shows an NW-SE trough axis over the continent. Type 6 (WW) has an intense SW flow over the southern part of the continent. Type 7 (NW) shows a very deep trough to the west of the continent, located over the Pacific Ocean at 80 degreesW and 34 degreesS. The continent is affected by a NW atmospheric circulation. Type 8 (R) represents a ridge over the continent with an intense NW flow in the south. The frequency of Types 1 to 8 is about 63\%. None of the circulation types mentioned accounts for more than 12\% of the sample. There is a considerable variability in monthly circulation type distributions; the first six types only account for approximately 50\% of the variability. This suggests that the use of probability models related to circulation type occurrence in the middle troposphere should be analysed on a monthly basis. The results attempt to summarize the region's synoptic regime through a small number of circulation types at 500 hPa and the corresponding 1000 hPa maps. The frequency distribution of each type during warm, neutral and cold phases in the equatorial Pacific Ocean was analysed. These results partially explain the best dynamic conditions (cyclonic vorticity), for the Argentine humid and semi-humid region, southern Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, that lead to the harvest precipitation events in spring (October-December 1982) with SOI {\textless} 0. In winter these circulation types are more important during cold phases with advection of cold and dry air (July- September 1982). The circulation types at 500 hPa and the corresponding maps at 1000 hPa associated with mean maximum and minimum monthly temperature and precipitation in the region are studied. The monthly maximum and minimum precipitation recorded in stations near the Uruguay River basin in southeastern South America and the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures from three stations in Argentina during 1980-88 are used in the analysis. Some of the daily patterns are strongly associated with the occurrence of maximum and minimum monthly temperature and precipitation in different places of the country. In reference to the maximum and minimum precipitation records, the behaviour of the variables under study is observed to be physically consistent with the associated circulation patterns.

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The term downscaling denotes a procedure in which local climatic information is derived from large-scale climate parameters. In this paper, the possibility of using as downscaling procedure a geostatistical interpolation technique known as kriging is explored. The authors present an example of the method by trying to reconstruct monthly winter precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula from the North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) field in wintertime (December- February). The main idea consists in reducing the spatial dimension of the large-scale SLP field by means of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Each observed SLP field is represented by a point in this low-dimensional space and this point is associated with the simultaneously observed rainfall. New values of the SLP field, for instance, those simulated by a general circulation model with modified greenhouse gas concentrations, can be represented by a new point in the EOF space. The rainfall amount to be associated to this point is estimated by kriging interpolation in the EOF space. The results obtained by this geostatistical approach are compared to the ones obtained by a simpler analog method by trying to reconstruct the observed rainfall from the SLP field in an independent period. It has been found that, generally, kriging and the analog method reproduce realistically the long-term mean, that kriging is somewhat better than the analog method in reproducing the rainfall evolution, but that,contrary to the analog method, it underestimates the variance because of the well-known smoothing effect. It is argued that there exists an intrinsic incompatibility between the estimation of the mean and replication of the variability. Finally, both methods have been also applied to daily winter rainfall. The methods are also validated by downscaling winter precipitation from SLP. It is concluded that kriging yields a better estimation of daily rainfall than the analog method, but the latter better reproduces the probability distribution of rainfall amounts and of the length of dry periods.},

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {Phenological observations are a valuable source of information for investigating the relationship between climate variation and plant development. Potential climate change in the future will shift the occurrence of phenological phases. Information about future climate conditions is needed in order to estimate this shift. General circulation models (GCM) provide the best information about future climate change. They are able to simulate reliably the most important mean features on a large scale, but they fail on a regional scale because of their low spatial resolution. A common approach to bridging the scale gap is statistical downscaling, which was used to relate the beginning of flowering of Taraxacum officinale in Slovenia with the monthly mean near-surface air temperature for January, February and March in Central Europe. Statistical models were developed and tested with NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis predictor data and EARS predictand data for the period 1960-1999. Prior to developing statistical models, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was employed on the predictor data. Multiple linear regression was used to relate the beginning of flowering with expansion coefficients of the first three EOF for the Janauary, Febrauary and March air temperatures, and a strong correlation was found between them. Developed statistical models were employed on the results of two GCM (HadCM3 and ECHAM4/OPYC3) to estimate the potential shifts in the beginning of flowering for the periods 1990-2019 and 2020-2049 in comparison with the period 1960-1989. The HadCM3 model predicts, on average, 4 days earlier occurrence and ECHAM4/OPYC3 5 days earlier occurrence of flowering in the period 1990-2019. The analogous results for the period 2020- 2049 are a 10- and 11-day earlier occurrence.},

	abstract = {In many instances, snow cover and duration are a major controlling factor on a range of environmental systems in mountain regions. When assessing the impacts of climatic change on mountain ecosystems and river basins whose origin lie in the Alps, one of the key controls on such systems will reside in changes in snow amount and duration. At present, regional climate models or statistical downscaling techniques, which are the principal methods applied to the derivation of climatic variables in a future, changing climate, do not provide adequate information at the scales required for investigations in which snow is playing a major role. A study has thus been undertaken on the behavior of snow in the Swiss Alps, in particular the duration of the seasonal snow-pack, on the basis of observational data from a number of Swiss climatological stations. It is seen that there is a distinct link between snow-cover duration and height (i.e., temperature), and that this link has a specific "signature" according to the type of winter. Milder winters are associated with higher precipitation levels than colder winters, but with more solid precipitation at elevations exceeding 1,700-2,000 m above sea-level, and more liquid precipitation below. These results can be combined within a single diagram, linking winter minimum temperature, winter precipitation, and snow-cover duration. The resulting contour surfaces can then be used to assess the manner in which the length of the snow-season may change according to specified shifts in temperature and precipitation. While the technique is clearly empirical, it can be combined with regional climate model information to provide a useful estimate of the length of the snow season with snow cover, for various climate-impacts studies.},

Now, new simulations with state-of-the-art climate models are becoming available for the next IPCC report \&\#91;the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)\&\#93;, and results from a number of these simulations are examined in order to determine whether they indicate a change in extreme precipitation on a monthly basis.

Results from empirically downscaled multimodel ensembles of temperature and precipitation for the period 2000- 50 are presented, based on common EOFs of large-scale temperature and sea level pressure fields. Comparisons with actual records for the past show that the multimodel ensemble range tends to span the observations. All scenarios for temperature change indicate a future warming, but the sea level pressure-based scenarios for precipitation are characterized by a large scatter about zero change. The primary cause for the large spread in precipitation trend estimates is attributed to differences between the various global climate scenarios. It is also acknowledged that the sea level pressure-based empirical models may underestimate the trends as they do not take directly into account increases in the precipitation due to increased temperatures. Nevertheless, in some locations the majority of the ensemble members suggest wetter springtime conditions.},

	abstract = {Nonhomogeneous hidden Markov models (NHMMs) provide a relatively simple framework for simulating precipitation at multiple rain gauge stations conditional on synoptic atmospheric patterns. Building on existing NHMMs for precipitation occurrences, we propose an extension to include precipitation amounts. The model we describe assumes the existence of unobserved (or hidden) weather patterns, the weather states, which follow a Markov chain. The weather states depend on observable synoptic information and therefore serve as a link between the synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns and the local-scale precipitation. The presence of the hidden states simplifies the spatio-temporal structure of the precipitation process. We assume the temporal dependence of precipitation is completely accounted for by the Markov evolution of the weather state. The spatial dependence of precipitation can also be partially or completely accounted for by the existence of a common weather state. In the proposed model, occurrences are assumed to be conditionally spatially independent given the current weather state and, conditional on occurrences, precipitation amounts are modeled independently at each rain gauge as gamma deviates with gauge-specific parameters. We apply these methods to model precipitation at a network of 24 rain gauge stations in Washington state over the course of 17 winters. The first 12 yr are used for model fitting purposes, while the last 5 serve to evaluate the model performance. The analysis of the model results for the reserved years suggests that the characteristics of the data are captured fairly well and points to possible directions for future improvements.},

The advantage of this method is that it minimizes the errors associated with the downscaling of future climate scenarios. The time series from the common EOF analysis are used both for the calibration of the statistical models and the prediction of future climate scenarios. This paper presents a systematic comparison between the common EOF approach and downscaling with a more conventional method based on the 'Perfect Prog' concept.
Three different sets of experiments are carried out where the two downscaling methods are compared, and the robustness of the methods is explored taking the predictor field from different regions. The analysis indicates that climate scenarios derived using the common EOF approach are associated with smaller errors. Another important finding is that the choice of predictor domain may influence the downscaled results, and that the merit of downscaling may depend on this area as well as location and season.

Using a series of linked models of climate, land cover, hydrology, and salmon population dynamics, we investigated the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of proposed habitat restoration efforts designed to recover depleted Chinook salmon populations in a Pacific Northwest river basin. Model results indicate a large negative impact of climate change on freshwater salmon habitat. Habitat restoration and protection can help to mitigate these effects and may allow populations to increase in the face of climate change. The habitat deterioration associated with climate change will, however, make salmon recovery targets much more difficult to attain. Because the negative impacts of climate change in this basin are projected to be most pronounced in relatively pristine, high-elevation streams where little restoration is possible, climate change and habitat restoration together are likely to cause a spatial shift in salmon abundance. River basins that span the current snow line appear especially vulnerable to climate change, and salmon recovery plans that enhance lower-elevation habitats are likely to be more successful over the next 50 years than those that target the higher-elevation basins likely to experience the greatest snow–rain transition.},

	abstract = {The statistical linkage of daily precipitation to the National Centers for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data is described for De Bilt and Maastricht (Netherlands), and for Hamburg, Hanover and Berlin (Germany), using daily data for the period 1968-97. Two separate models were used to describe the daily precipitation at a particular site: an additive logistic model for rainfall occurrence and a generalized additive model for wet-day rainfall. Several dynamical variables and atmospheric moisture were included as predictor variables. The relative humidity at 700 hPa was considered as the moisture variable for rainfall occurrence modelling. For rainfall amount modelling, two options were compared: (i) the use of the specific humidity at 700 hPa, and (ii) the use of both the relative humidity at 700 hPa and precipitable water. An application is given with data from a time-dependent greenhouse gas forcing experiment using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model for the periods 1968-97 and 2070-99. The fitted statistical relationships were used to estimate the changes in the mean number of wet days and the mean rainfall amounts for the winter and summer halves of the year at De Bilt, Hanover and Berlin. A decrease in the mean number of wet days was found. Despite this decrease, an increase in the mean seasonal rainfall amounts is predicted if specific humidity is used in the model for wet-day rainfall. This is caused by the larger atmospheric water content in the future climate. The effect of the increased atmospheric moisture is smaller if the alternative wet-day rainfall amount model with precipitable water and relative humidity is applied. Except for an anomalous change in mean winter rainfall at Hanover, the estimated changes from the latter model correspond quite well with those from the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model. Despite the flexibility of generalized additive models, the rainfall amount model systematically overpredicts the mean rainfall amounts in situations where extreme rainfall could be expected. Interaction between predictor effects has to be incorporated to reduce this bias. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Interest in stochastic downscaling has grown from the inability of general circulation models (GCMs) and limited area models (LAMs) to reproduce observed daily precipitation statistics at local and regional scales under present climate conditons. Although GCMs and LAMs perform reasonably well in simulating synoptic atmospheric fields, they tend to over-estimate the frequency and under-estimate the intensity of daily precipitation. This paper describes the application of a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) fitted to observed atmospheric and precipitation data to a LAM simulation for South-West Western Australia. The NHMM is unique amongst stochastic downscaling methods in that it determines the most distinct patterns in a multi-site, precipitation occurrence record rather than patterns in atmospheric fields. These patterns can in turn be defined as conditionally dependent on a range of daily atmospheric series. We compare the LAM simulation and the downscaled LAM simulation with observed 'winter' precipitation statistics at six stations near Perth, Western Australia. The results show that the downscaled simulations reproduce observed precipitation probabilities and wet and dry spell frequencies at each station. The LAM simulation tends to under-estimate the frequency of dry spells and over-estimate the probability of precipitation and the frequency of wet spells. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stochastic downscaling is related to synoptic climatology, weather-typing approaches (classifying circulation patterns) such as the Lamb Weather Types developed for the United Kingdom (UK), the European Grosswetterlagen (Bardossy and Plate, 1992) and the Perfect Prognosis (Perfect Frog) method from numerical weather prediction. The large-scale atmospheric circulation is linked with site-specific observations of atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, wind speed or temperature, within a specified region. Classifying each day by circulation patterns is achieved by clustering algorithms, fuzzy rule bases, neural nets or decision trees. The linkages are extended to GCM output to account for climate change. Stochastic models are developed from the probability distributions for extreme events. Objective analysis can be used to interpolate values of these models to other locations.

We present a possible mechanism linking snowmelt rate and streamflow generation using a gridded implementation of the Budyko framework. We computed an ensemble of Budyko streamflow anomalies (BSAs) using Variable Infiltration Capacity model-simulated evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and estimated precipitation at 1/16° resolution from 1950 to 2013. BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r2 = 0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work.},

	abstract = {The Colorado River supplies water to 27 million users in 7 states and 2 countries and irrigates over 3 million acres of farmland. Global climate models almost unanimously project that human-induced climate change will reduce runoff in this region by 10–30\%. This work explores whether currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River system are sustainable under different climate-change scenarios. If climate change reduces runoff by 10\%, scheduled deliveries will be missed ≈58\% of the time by 2050. If runoff reduces 20\%, they will be missed ≈88\% of the time. The mean shortfall when full deliveries cannot be met increases from ≈0.5–0.7 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/yr) in 2025 to ≈1.2–1.9 bcm/yr by 2050 out of a request of ≈17.3 bcm/yr. Such values are small enough to be manageable. The chance of a year with deliveries {\textless}14.5 bcm/yr increases to 21\% by midcentury if runoff reduces 20\%, but such low deliveries could be largely avoided by reducing scheduled deliveries. These results are computed by using estimates of Colorado River flow from the 20th century, which was unusually wet; if the river reverts to its long-term mean, shortfalls increase another 1–1.5 bcm/yr. With either climate-change or long-term mean flows, currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River are not sustainable. However, the ability of the system to mitigate droughts can be maintained if the various users of the river find a way to reduce average deliveries.},

	abstract = {We discuss equilibrium changes in daily extreme surface air temperature and precipitation events in response to doubled atmospheric CO2, simulated in an ensemble of 53 versions of HadSM3, consisting of the HadAM3 atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a mixed layer ocean. By virtue of its size and design, the ensemble, which samples uncertainty arising from the parameterisation of atmospheric physical processes and the effects of natural variability, provides a first opportunity to quantify the robustness of predictions of changes in extremes obtained from GCM simulations. Changes in extremes are quantified by calculating the frequency of exceedance of a fixed threshold in the 2 x CO2 simulation relative to the 1 x CO2 simulation. The ensemble-mean value of this relative frequency provides a best estimate of the expected change while the range of values across the ensemble provides a measure of the associated uncertainty. For example, when the extreme threshold is defined as the 99th percentile of the 1 x CO2 distribution, the global-mean ensemble-mean relative frequency of extremely warm days is found to be 20 in January, and 28 in July, implying that events occurring on one day per hundred under present day conditions would typically occur on 20-30 days per hundred under 2 x CO2 conditons. However the ensemble range in the relative frequency is of similar magnitude to the ensemble-mean value, indicating considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of the increase. The relative frequencies in response to doubled CO2 become smaller as the threshold used to define the extreme event is reduced. For one variable (July maximum daily temperature) we investigate this simulated variation with threshold, showing that it can be quite well reproduced by assuming the response to doubling CO2 to be characterised simply as a uniform shift of a Gaussian distribution. Nevertheless, doubling CO2 does lead to changes in the shape of the daily distributions for both temperature and precipitation, but the effect of these changes on the relative frequency of extreme events is generally larger for precipitation. For example, around one-fifth of the globe exhibits ensemble-mean decreases in time-averaged precipitation accompanied by increases in the frequency of extremely wet days. The ensemble range of changes in precipitation extremes (relative to the ensemble mean of the changes) is typically larger than for temperature extremes, indicating greater uncertainty in the precipitation changes. In the global average, extremely wet days are predicted to become twice as common under 2 x CO2 conditions. We also consider changes in extreme seasons, finding that simulated increases in the frequency of extremely warm or wet seasons under 2 x CO2 are almost everywhere greater than the corresponding increase in daily extremes. The smaller increases in the frequency of daily extremes is explained by the influence of day-to-day weather variability which inflates the variance of daily distributions compared to their seasonal counterparts.},

	abstract = {A stochastic space-time model for generating daily precipitation series has been applied in the upper Neckar catchment (Germany). The stochastic model is downscaling precipitation from the atmospheric circulation. Automated, objective and optimized classification method has been used in order to get daily series of circulation patterns. The classification was done with special emphasis of precipitation extremes. The precipitation model is conditioned on atmospheric circulation patterns and uses an multivariate autoregressive AR(1) concept to reproduce the time persistence; the annual cycle is reproduced by using Fourier series. By computing spatial covariances the spatial structure of precipitation fields is taken into account. Comparison between observed. and simulated areal precipitation computed by means of external drift kriging shows that the simulated results agree fairly well with observed data (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

	volume = {27},
	doi = {doi:10.1002/joc.1556},
	abstract = {Abstract There is now a large published literature on the strengths and weaknesses of downscaling methods for different climatic variables, in different regions and seasons. However, little attention is given to the choice of downscaling method when examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological systems. This review paper assesses the current downscaling literature, examining new developments in the downscaling field specifically for hydrological impacts. Sections focus on the downscaling concept; new methods; comparative methodological studies; the modelling of extremes; and the application to hydrological impacts. Consideration is then given to new developments in climate scenario construction which may offer the most potential for advancement within the ‘downscaling for hydrological impacts’ community, such as probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling and downscaling of multiple variables and suggests ways that they can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess the uncertainties associated with future projections. Within hydrological impact studies there is still little consideration given to applied research; how the results can be best used to enable stakeholders and managers to make informed, robust decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of many uncertainties about the future. It is suggested that there is a need for a move away from comparison studies into the provision of decision-making tools for planning and management that are robust to future uncertainties; with examination and understanding of uncertainties within the modelling system.

We show that the tropics and subtropics are linked by teleconnections that induce seasonal RH variations that relate strongly to albedo (via clouds), and that this covariability is mimicked in a warming climate. A present-day analog for future trends is thus identified whereby the intensity of subtropical dry zones in models associated with the boreal monsoon is strongly linked to projected cloud trends, reflected solar radiation, and model sensitivity. Many models, particularly those with low climate sensitivity, fail to adequately resolve these teleconnections and hence are identifiably biased. Improving model fidelity in matching observed variations provides a viable path forward for better predicting future climate.},

	abstract = {While it is widely accepted that the global mean atmospheric temperature has increased in recent decades, the spatial distribution of global warming has been complex. In this study we comprehensively characterize the spatial pattern, including vertical structure, of temperature trends along the subtropical west coast of South America (continental Chile) for the period 1979\&\#8211;2006 and examine their consistency with expectations based on the CMIP-3 ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations for the late 20th century. In central and northern Chile (17°\&\#8211;37°S) the most notable feature is a strong contrast between surface cooling at coastal stations (\&\#8722;0.2°C/decade) and warming in the Andes (+0.25°C/decade), only 100\&\#8211;200 km further inland. Coastal radiosonde data imply that the coast-Andes variation is largely due to strong vertical stratification of temperature trends in the atmosphere west of the Andes. The coastal cooling appears to form part of a larger-scale, La Niña-like pattern and may extend below the ocean mixed layer to depths of at least 500 m. Over continental Chile the CMIP-3 GCM ensemble predicts temperature trends similar to those observed in the Andes. The cooling along the Chilean coast is not reproduced by the models, but the mean SST warming is weaker there than any other part of the world except the Southern Ocean. It is proposed that the intensification of the South Pacific Anticyclone during recent decades, which is also a simulated consequence of global warming, is likely to play a major role in maintaining cooler temperatures off the coast of Chile.},

	abstract = {To understand how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may affect future stratospheric ozone, 21st century projections from four chemistry-climate models are examined for their dependence on six different GHG scenarios. Compared to higher GHG emissions, lower emissions result in smaller increases in tropical upwelling with resultant smaller reductions in ozone in the tropical lower stratosphere and less severe stratospheric cooling with resultant smaller increases in upper stratospheric ozone globally. Increases in reactive nitrogen and hydrogen that lead to additional chemical ozone destruction mainly play a role in scenarios with higher GHG emissions. Differences among the six GHG scenarios are found to be largest over northern midlatitudes (\&\#8764;20 DU by 2100) and in the Arctic (\&\#8764;40 DU by 2100) with divergence mainly in the second half of the 21st century. The uncertainty in the return of stratospheric column ozone to 1980 values arising from different GHG scenarios is comparable to or less than the uncertainty that arises from model differences in the larger set of 17 CCMVal-2 SRES A1B simulations.

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {As the debate on potential climate change continues, it is becoming increasingly clear that the main concerns to the general public are the potential impacts of a change in the climate on societal and biophysical systems. In order to address these concerns researchers need realistic, plausible scenarios of climate change suitable for use in impacts analysis. It is the purpose of this paper to present a downscaling method useful for developing these types of scenarios that are grounded in both General Circulation Model simulations of climate change, and in situ station data. Free atmosphere variables for four gridpoints over the Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas (MINK) region from both control and transient simulations from the GFDL General Circulation Model were used with thirty years of nearby station data to generate surface maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation. The free atmosphere variables were first subject to a principal components analysis with the principal component (PC) scores used in a multiple regression to relate the upper-air variables to surface temperature and precipitation. Coefficients from the regression on station data were then used with PC scores from the model simulations to generate maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. The statistical distributions of the downscaled temperatures and precipitation for the control run are compared with those from the observed station data. Results for the transient run are then examined. Lastly, annual time series of temperature for the downscaling results show less warming over the period of the transient simulation than the time series produced directly from the model.},

	abstract = {An economic-engineering optimization model of California's major water supply system is presented. The model's development, calibration, limitations, and results are reviewed. The major methodological conclusions are that large-scale water resources optimization models driven by economic objective functions are both possible and practical; deterministic models are useful despite their limitations; and data management, reconciliation, and documentation are important benefits of large-scale system modeling. Specific results for California indicate a great potential for water markets and conjunctive use to improve economic performance and significant economic value for expanding some conveyance facilities. Overall, economic-engineering optimization (even if deterministic) can suggest a variety of promising approaches for managing large systems. These approaches can then be refined and tested using more detailed simulation models. The process of developing large-scale models also motivates the systematic and integrated treatment of surface water, groundwater, facility, and water demand data, and identification of particularly important data problems, something of long-term value for all types of water resources analysis.},

	title = {Creating daily weather series with use of the weather generator},
	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Estimation of quantitative impacts of potential climate change on environment and various aspects of human existence requires high-resolution surface weather data. Since the direct output from general circulation models (GCMs) is unreliable at the local scale, alternative approaches - most frequently based on statistical techniques - should be used to downscale coarsely resolved GCM output patterns to finer spatial and/or temporal resolution. The downscaling techniques are briefly reviewed in the paper. Two of the approaches were followed in developing two versions of the stochastic weather generator (WG) called Met\&Roll: (i) generation of synthetic weather series by generator with parameters derived from the local observed series and then modified according to the climate change scenario that prescribes monthly increments of the individual variables; (ii) downscaling the GCM-simulated daily circulation pattern, using statistical linkage between the circulation patterns and the surface weather characteristics. Met\&Roll-1 is a four-variate surface weather generator which employs a Markov chain approach to model precipitation occurrence and an autoregressive model to simulate the solar radiation and the diurnal extreme temperatures. The validation of the generator is performed by comparison of the stochastic structure of observed and synthetic series. Uncertainties in projecting the climate change scenario into the parameters of the WG are discussed. Met\&Roll-2 is a generator which links the four surface weather variables with upper-air circulation patterns (CPs). CPs are characterized by principal components derived from 500 hPa geopotential field. The series of CPs is either generated by autoregressive model or taken from the GCM output. The first test of this generator is focused on the correlation between CPs and surface weather characteristics. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic responses of river basins in the Sierra Nevada of California to historical and future climate variations and changes are assessed by simulating daily streamflow and water-balance responses to simulated climate variations over a continuous 200-yr period. The coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice-land Parallel Climate Model provides the simulated climate histories, and existing hydrologic models of the Merced, Carson, and American Rivers are used to simulate the basin responses. The historical simulations yield stationary climate and hydrologic variations through the first part of the 20th century until about 1975 when temperatures begin to warm noticeably and when snowmelt and streamflow peaks begin to occur progressively earlier within the seasonal cycle. A future climate simulated with business-as-usual increases in greenhouse-gas and aerosol radiative forcings continues those recent trends through the 21st century with an attendant + 2.5 degreesC warming and a hastening of snowmelt and streamflow within the seasonal cycle by almost a month. The various projected trends in the business-as-usual simulations become readily visible despite realistic simulated natural climatic and hydrologic variability by about 2025. In contrast to these changes that are mostly associated with streamflow timing, long-term average totals of streamflow and other hydrologic fluxes remain similar to the historical mean in all three simulations. A control simulation in which radiative forcings are held constant at 1995 levels for the 50 years following 1995 yields climate and streamflow timing conditions much like the 1980s and 1990s throughout its duration. The availability of continuous climate-change projection outputs and careful design of initial conditions and control experiments, like those utilized here, promise to improve the quality and usability of future climate-change impact assessments.},

	abstract = {doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2016v14iss3art6 Anthropogenic climate change amounts to a rapidly approaching, “new” stressor in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta system. In response to California’s extreme natural hydroclimatic variability, complex water-management systems have been developed, even as the Delta’s natural ecosystems have been largely devastated. Climate change is projected to challenge these management and ecological systems in different ways that are characterized by different levels of uncertainty. For example, there is high certainty that climate will warm by about 2°C more (than late-20th-century averages) by mid-century and about 4°C by end of century, if greenhouse-gas emissions continue their current rates of acceleration. Future precipitation changes are much less certain, with as many climate models projecting wetter conditions as drier. However, the same projections agree that precipitation will be more intense when storms do arrive, even as more dry days will separate storms. Warmer temperatures will likely enhance evaporative demands and raise water temperatures. Consequently, climate change is projected to yield both more extreme flood risks and greater drought risks. Sea level rise (SLR) during the 20th century was about 22 cm, and is projected to increase by at least 3-fold this century. SLR together with land subsidence threatens the Delta with greater vulnerabilities to inundation and salinity intrusion. Effects on the Delta ecosystem that are traceable to warming include SLR, reduced snowpack, earlier snowmelt and larger storm-driven streamflows, warmer and longer summers, warmer summer water temperatures, and water-quality changes. These changes and their uncertainties will challenge the operations of water projects and uses throughout the Delta’s watershed and delivery areas. Although the effects of of climate change on Delta ecosystems may be profound, the end results are difficult to predict, except that native species will fare worse than invaders. Successful preparation for the coming changes will require greater integration of monitoring, modeling, and decision making across time, variables, and space than has been historically normal.},

	abstract = {The extent to which winter precipitation is orographically enhanced within the Sierra Nevada of California varies from storm to storm, and season to season, from occasions when precipitation rates at low and high altitudes are almost the same to instances when precipitation rates at middle elevations ( considered here) can be as much as 30 times more than at the base of the range. Analyses of large-scale conditions associated with orographic precipitation variations during storms and seasons from 1954 to 1999 show that strongly orographic storms most commonly have winds that transport water vapor across the range from a more nearly westerly direction than during less orographic storms and than during the largest overall storms, and generally the strongly orographic storms are less convectively stable. Strongly orographic conditions often follow heavy precipitation events because both of these wind conditions are present in midlatitude cyclones that form the cores of many Sierra Nevada storms. Storms during La Nina winters tend to yield larger orographic ratios (ORs) than do those during El Ninos. A simple experiment with a model of streamflows from a river basin draining the central Sierra Nevada indicates that, for a fixed overall basin-precipitation amount, a decrease in OR contributes to larger winter flood peaks and smaller springtime flows, and thus to an overall hastening of the runoff season.},

	title = {Multifractal modeling of anomalous scaling laws in rainfall},
	volume = {35},
	abstract = {The coupling of hydrological distributed models to numerical weather prediction outputs is an important issue for hydrological applications such as forecasting of flood events. Downscaling meteorological predictions to the hydrological scales requires the resolution of two fundamental issues regarding precipitation, namely, (1) understanding the statistical properties and scaling laws of rainfall fields and (2) validation of downscaling models that are able to preserve statistical characteristics observed in real precipitation. In this paper we discuss the first issue by introducing a new multifractal model that appears particularly suitable for random generation of synthetic rainfall. We argue that the results presented in this paper may be also useful for the solution of the second question. Statistical behavior of rainfall in time is investigated through a high-resolution time series recorded in Geneva (Italy). The multifractal analysis shows the presence of a temporal threshold, localized around 15-20 hours, which separates two ranges of anomalous scaling laws. Synthetic time series, characterized by very similar scaling laws to the observed one, are generated with the multifractal model. The potential of the model for extreme rainfall event distributions is also discussed. The multifractal analysis of Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) radar fields have shown that statistical properties of rainfall in space depend on time durations over which precipitation is accumulated. Further analysis of some rainfall fields produced with a meteorological limited area model exhibited the same anomalous scaling as the GATE fields.},

	title = {Impact of climate change on slope stability using expanded downscaling},
	volume = {55},
	abstract = {Climate parameters affecting ground water and pore pressure fluctuations can, in many cases, trigger slope instability and hence landslide activity. Global warming due to the greenhouse effect and especially changes in precipitation patterns and air temperature might therefore have influences on future landslide activity. The present paper shows an assessment of climate change consequences for displacement rates of a mudslide in the Dolomites, Italy. The study is based on climate projections of a general circulation model (GCM). GCMs are able to successfully reproduce large-scale patterns of climate, while they show a poor performance on the regional scale. Therefore, GCM output is postprocessed with a statistical downscaling technique to derive local-scale climate change information from simulated atmospheric circulation patterns of the European- North Atlantic sector. The resulting precipitation and temperature series are introduced in a hydrological tank model, which calculates daily groundwater levels. Based on the groundwater data, a visco-plastic rheological model is applied to derive displacement rates of the mudslide as final output. The climate change signal is most pronounced for air temperature, while it is weaker but still significant for yearly precipitation, which is decreasing. As a consequence, yearly displacement rates show a significant reduction. The most dramatic changes, however, occur in spring with strongly lowered groundwater levels and consequently decreasing displacement rates. This is seen as an effect of reduced storage of winter precipitation as snow and hence decreasing meltwater amounts in early spring. The presented model chain with statistical downscaling, hydrological and rheological models allows the assessment of future landslide displacement affected by the greenhouse effect. The results, however, have to be taken with caution since in all parts of the model chain there are uncertainties that are difficult to address. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the reliability of some of the more important remotely sensed daily precipitation products available for South America as a precursor to the possible implementation of a South America Land Data Assimilation System. Precipitation data fields calculated as 6 hour predictions by the CPTEC Eta model and three different satellite-derived estimates of precipitation (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)) are compared with the available observations of daily total rainfall across South America. To make this comparison, the threat score, fractional-covered area, and relative volumetric bias of the model-calculated and remotely sensed estimates are computed for the year 2000. The results show that the Eta model-calculated data and the NESDIS product capture the area without precipitation within the domain reasonably well, while the TRMM and PERSIANN products tend to underestimate the area without precipitation and to heavily overestimate the area with a small amount of precipitation. In terms of precipitation amount the NESDIS product significantly overestimates and the TRMM product significantly underestimates precipitation, while the Eta model-calculated data and PERSIANN product broadly match the domain average observations. However, both tend to bias the zonal location of precipitation more heavily toward the equator than the observations. In general, the Eta model-calculated data outperform the several remotely sensed data products currently available and evaluated in the present study.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimate that nearly 900 million people on the planet are suffering from chronic hunger. This state of affairs led to the making of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in 2000, having the first goal to “Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger” with a target to halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. However, projections of a rapidly growing population, coupled with global climate change, is expected to have significant negative impacts on food security. To investigate this prospect, a modelling framework was developed under the QUEST-GSI programme, which we have termed FEEDME (Food Estimation and Export for Diet and Malnutrition Evaluation). The model uses country-level Food Balance Sheets (FBS) to determine mean calories on a per-capita basis, and a coefficient of variation to account for the degree of inequality in access to food across national populations. Calorific values of individual food items in the FBS of countries were modified by revision of crop yields and population changes under the SRES A1B climate change and social-economic scenarios respectively for 2050, 2085 and 2100. Under a no-climate change scenario, based upon projected changes in population and agricultural land use only, results show that 31 \% (2.5 billion people by 2050) of the global population is at risk of undernourishment if no adaptation or agricultural innovation is made in the intervening years. An additional 21 \% (1.7 billion people) is at risk of undernourishment by 2050 when climate change is taken into account. However, the model does not account for future trends in technology, improved crop varieties or agricultural trade interventions, although it is clear that all of these adaptation strategies will need to be embraced on a global scale if society is to ensure adequate food supplies for a projected global population of greater than 9 billion people.},

	abstract = {Abstract Partial-duration maximum precipitation series from Historical Climatology Network stations are used as a basis for assessing trends in extreme-precipitation recurrence-interval amounts. Two types of time series are analyzed: running series in which the generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution is fit to separate overlapping 30-yr data series and lengthening series in which more recent years are iteratively added to a base series from the early part of the record. Resampling procedures are used to assess both trend and field significance. Across the United States, nearly two-thirds of the trends in the 2-, 5-, and 10-yr return-period rainfall amounts, as well as the GEV distribution location parameter, are positive. Significant positive trends in these values tend to cluster in the Northeast, western Great Lakes, and Pacific Northwest. Slopes are more pronounced in the 1960?2007 period when compared with the 1950?2007 interval. In the Northeast and western Great Lakes, the 2-yr return-period precipitation amount increases at a rate of approximately 2\% per decade, whereas the change in the 100-yr storm amount is between 4\% and 9\% per decade. These changes result primarily from an increase in the location parameter of the fitted GEV distribution. Collectively, these increases result in a median 20\% decrease in the expected recurrence interval, regardless of interval length. Thus, at stations across a large part of the eastern United States and Pacific Northwest, the 50-yr storm based on 1950?79 data can be expected to occur on average once every 40 yr, when data from the 1950?2007 period are considered.},

This is an emerging field of research, characterized by a wide variety of techniques, a diversity of geographical contexts, a general absence of intermodel comparisons, and inconsistent reporting of model skill. This article begins by outlining the basic principles of ANN modelling, common network architectures and training algorithms. The discussion then addresses related themes of the division and preprocessing of data for model calibration/validation; data standardization techniques; and methods of evaluating ANN model performance. A literature survey underlines the need for clear guidance in current modelling practice, as well as the comparison of ANN methods with more conventional statistical models. Accordingly, a template is proposed in order to assist the construction of future ANN rainfall-runoff models. Finally, it is suggested that research might focus on the extraction of hydrological 'rules' from ANN weights, and on the development of standard performance measures that penalize unnecessary model complexity.},

Given relatively brief calibration data sets it was possible to construct robust models of 15-min flows with six hour lead times for the Rivers Amber and Mole. Comparisons were made between the performance of the ANN and those of conventional flood forecasting systems. The results obtained for validation forecasts were of comparable quality to those obtained from operational systems for the River Amber. The ability of the ANN to cope with missing data and to "learn" from the event currently being forecast in real time makes it an appealing alternative to conventional lumped or semi- distributed flood forecasting models. However, further research is required to determine the optimum ANN training period for a given catchment, season and hydrological contexts.},

All models were trained using 15 minute rainfall-runoff data for the River Mole, a flood-prone tributary of the River Thames, UK. The models were then used to forecast river flows with a 6 hour lead time and 15 minute resolution, given only antecedent rainfall and discharge measurements. Two seasons (winter and spring) were selected for model testing using a cross-validation technique and a range of diagnostic statistics. Overall, the MLP was more skillful than the RBF, SWMLR and ZOF models. However, the RBF flow forecasts were only marginally better than those of the simpler SWMLR and ZOF models. The results compare favourably with a review of previous studies and further endorse claims that ANNs are well suited to rainfall-runoff modelling and (potentially) real-time flood forecasting.},

	abstract = {This study examines the geographic structure of observed trends in key hydrologically relevant variables across the western United States at (1)/(8)degrees spatial resolution during the period 1950-99. Geographical regions, latitude bands, and elevation classes where these trends are statistically significantly different from trends associated with natural climate variations are identified. Variables analyzed include late-winter and spring temperature, winter-total snowy days as a fraction of winter-total wet days, 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) as a fraction of October-March (ONDJFM) precipitation total [precip(ONDJFM)], and seasonal [JFM] accumulated runoff as a fraction of water-year accumulated runoff. Observed changes were compared to natural internal climate variability simulated by an 850-yr control run of the finite volume version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3-FV), statistically downscaled to a (1)/(8)degrees grid using the method of constructed analogs. Both observed and downscaled model temperature and precipitation data were then used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model to obtain the hydrological variables analyzed in this study. Large trends (magnitudes found less than 5\% of the time in the long control run) are common in the observations and occupy a substantial part (37\%-42\%) of the mountainous western United States. These trends are strongly related to the large-scale warming that appears over 89\% of the domain. The strongest changes in the hydrologic variables, unlikely to be associated with natural variability alone, have occurred at medium elevations [750-2500 m for JFM runoff fractions and 500-3000 m for SWE/Precip(ONDJFM)] where warming has pushed temperatures from slightly below to slightly above freezing. Further analysis using the data on selected catchments indicates that hydroclimatic variables must have changed significantly (at 95\% confidence level) over at least 45\% of the total catchment area to achieve a detectable trend in measures accumulated to the catchment scale.},

	abstract = {Natural variability of the climate system imposes a large uncertainty on future climate change signals simulated by a single integration of any coupled ocean-atmosphere model. This is especially true for regional precipitation changes. Here, these uncertainties are reduced by using results from two ensembles of five integrations of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model forced by projected future greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol changes. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the simulations show a global warming of similar to1.9 degreesC over the. twenty-first century (continuing the trend observed since the late 1970s), accompanied by a similar to3\% increase in global precipitation. Stabilizing the CO2 level at 550 ppm reduces the warming only moderately (by similar to0.4 degreesC in 2100). The patterns of seasonal-mean temperature and precipitation change in the two cases are highly correlated (r approximate to 0.99 for temperature and r approximate to 0.93 for precipitation). Over the midlatitude North Atlantic Ocean, the model produces a moderate surface cooling (1 degrees -2 degreesC, mostly in winter) over the twenty-first century. This cooling is accompanied by changes in atmospheric lapse rates over the region (i.e., larger warming in the free troposphere than at the surface), which stabilizes the surface ocean. The resultant reduction in local oceanic convection contributes to a 20\% slowdown in the thermohaline circulation.},

It will be decades before GCMs will be able to resolve scales small enough for most effects research, so climatologists have developed climate downscaling methods to bridge the gap between the global and local scales. There are two main streams of climate downscaling research. First, high-resolution, limited-area climate models can be embedded in the coarse-scale GCMs, producing much finer resolution climate data. Second, empirical downscaling techniques develop transfer functions linking the large-scale atmospheric circulation generated by the GCMs to surface data. Examples of both types of downscaling, aimed at improving projections of future climate in the Susquehanna River Basin (the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States), are presented. A third case is also described in which an even higher- resolution nested atmospheric model is being developed and linked to a hydrologic model system, with the ultimate goal of simulating the environmental response to climate forcing at all time and space scales.},

The new generation of non-flux-adjusted control runs are nearly as stable as-and agree with observations nearly as well as-the flux-adjusted models. Both flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models simulate an overall level of natural internal climate variability that is within the bounds set by observations. These developments represent significant progress in the state of the art of climate modeling since the Second (1995) Scientific Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; see Gates et al. [Gates, W.L., et al., 1996. Climate models-Evaluation. Climate Climate 1995: The Science of Climate Change, Houghton, J.T., et al. (Eds.), Cambridge Univ. Press, pp. 229-284]). In the increasing-CO2 runs, differences between different models, while substantial, are not as great as one might expect from earlier assessments that relied on equilibrium climate sensitivity.

Featuring 0.125° spatial resolution, hourly temporal resolution, nine primary forcing fields, and six secondary validation/model development fields, each data set is based on a backbone of Eta Data Assimilation System/Eta data and is supplemented with observation-based precipitation and radiation data. Hourly observation-based precipitation data are derived from a combination of daily National Center for Environmental Prediction Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gauge-based precipitation analyses and hourly National Weather Service Doppler radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation analyses, wherein the hourly radar-based analyses are used to temporally disaggregate the daily CPC analyses. NLDAS observation-based shortwave values are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite radiation data processed at the University of Maryland and at the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. Extensive quality control and validation efforts have been conducted on the NLDAS forcing data sets, and favorable comparisons have taken place with Oklahoma Mesonet, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program/cloud and radiation test bed, and Surface Radiation observation data. The real-time forcing data set is constantly evolving to make use of the latest advances in forcing-related data sets, and all of the real-time and retrospective data are available online at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov for visualization and downloading in both full and subset forms.},

	abstract = {Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a k-means clustering algorithm, daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) fields over the northeastern Atlantic and Western Europe, simulated by the Hadley Centre's second generation coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (HADCM2) control run (HADCM2CON), are validated by comparison with the observed daily MSLP fields. It is clear that HADCM2 reproduces daily MSLP fields and its seasonal variability over the region very well, despite suffering from some deficiencies, such as the systematic displacement of the atmospheric centres of action. Four daily circulation patterns, previously identified from the observed daily MSLP fields over the area and well related to daily precipitation in Portugal, were also well classified from the daily MSLP fields simulated by HADCM2. The model can also simulate rather successfully the relationships between the four daily circulation patterns and daily precipitation in southern Portugal. However. compared with observations, daily precipitation intensities simulated by the model are too weak in southern Portugal. Nevertheless, HADCM2 represents a considerable improvement relative to the UKTR experiment. The results described here imply that it is doubtful whether regional precipitation scenarios provided by HADCM2 can be directly applied in impact studies and that a downscaling technique, based on daily circulation patterns, might be successful in reproducing local and regional precipitation characteristics. Moreover, the four circulation patterns call also be clearly identified in the two perturbed experiments, one under greenhouse gases forcing only (HADCM2GHG) and the ether under additional forcing of sulphate aerosol (HADCM2SUL), although changes in the frequencies of occurrence of certain circulation patterns are found. Nevertheless, the observed links between regional precipitation in southern Portugal and large-scale atmospheric circulation seem likely to hold in the model's perturbed climate. It is therefore credible to use those links to downscale large-scale atmospheric circulation from GCM simulations to obtain future precipitation scenarios in southern Portugal.},

In the future projections all the models show a temperature increase of up to 4° by the end of the 21st century throughout the Alps and this leads to an anticipation of SDR timing throughout the year that can span from 1 to 3 months depending on the model horizontal resolution. These timing changes are associated with changes in snow cover modulated by the complex Alpine topography. In fact, model resolution plays a critical role in regulating the magnitude, timing and spatial distribution of the response of snow cover and SDR to warming. We find that the accurate simulation of changes in runoff timing requires a high resolution representation of the Alpine topography, and can be important for water storage regulations concerning energy production, agriculture and domestic use.},

	title = {Precipitation and air flow indices over the {British} {Isles}},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {The relationships between regional daily precipitation time series in the British isles and 3 indices of air flow are examined with a view to assessing their potential for use in GCM downscaling. These indices, calculated from daily grid- point sea-level pressure data, are as follows: total shear vorticity, a measure of the degree of cyclonicity; strength of the resultant flow; and angular direction of flow. The 3 indices, particularly vorticity, exert a strong control over daily precipitation characteristics such as the probability and amount of precipitation. There are significant regional differences in the relationships with precipitation, particularly between the England and Wales series and the Scotland and Northern Ireland series. Comparison of the relationships between air flow indices and regional and 2 single site precipitation series in England shows they are similar, although at the site-scale local factors may play an important role in affecting the relationships with the indices. Two models for generating daily precipitation series from vorticity are presented and evaluated by their ability to reproduce the following characteristics of precipitation over an independent validation period: annual totals and interannual variability, wet day probability and spell duration, and size of daily precipitation amounts. Model 1 is based on empirical relationships between vorticity and precipitation. Model 2 is based on user-defined categories of vorticity. The results for 2 sites (Durham and Kempsford) show that both models reproduce key characteristics of the observed daily precipitation series. Differences in model structure and number of parameters affect their accuracy in simulating the interannual variability and daily characteristics of precipitation. The air flow indices represent a significant advantage over traditional weather types because they are continuous variables. Previous downscaling techniques have relied upon classification techniques that impose artificial boundaries to define classes that may contain a wide range of conditions and no information about the intensity of development of the weather system concerned. As the 3 air flow indices are the basic determinants for describing the day's weather in many parts of the world, there is significant potential to apply this technique to other such regions. An example is shown of the relationships between daily precipitation in Switzerland and the air flow indices. The models may also be applied to the development of future daily precipitation scenarios using the coarse-scale output of GCM pressure fields.},

	volume = {213},
	abstract = {A variety of different methods have been proposed for downscaling large-scale General Circulation Model (GCM) output to the time and space scales required for climate impact studies. Using weather types to achieve this goal provides greater understanding of the problems that are involved compared to the many "black box" techniques that have been proposed. Analyses using Lamb weather types, counts of weather fronts and air flow indices over the British Isles show strong relationships with daily rainfall characteristics such as the probability and amount of rainfall. Three versions of a weather type method are described for generating daily rainfall series. Two methods use an objective scheme to classify daily circulation types over the British isles along the lines of Lamb's subjective classification. The third method is based on user-defined categories of vorticity. Each method categorises rainfall events according to whether the previous day was wet or dry. All three methods successfully reproduce the monthly means, persistence and interannual variability of two daily rainfall time series during a validation period. A significant advantage of using vorticity is that it is a continuous variable and is strongly related to the probability of rainfall and the magnitude of rainfall events. The paper ends with a discussion of the issues relevant to the application of this method to the development of climate scenarios from GCMs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Scenarios of global climate change were examined to see what impacts they might have on transboundary water management in the Columbia River basin. Scenario changes in natural streamflow were estimated using a basin hydrology model. These scenarios tended to show earlier seasonal peaks, with possible reductions in total annual flow and lower minimum flows. Impacts and adaptation responses to the natural streamflow scenarios were determined through two exercises: (a) estimations of system reliability using a reservoir model with performance measures and (b) interviews with water managers and other stakeholders in the Canadian portion of the basin. Results from the two exercises were similar, suggesting a tendency towards reduced reliability to meet objectives for power production, fisheries, and agriculture. Reliability to meet flood control objectives would be relatively unchanged in some scenarios but reduced in others. This exercise suggests that despite the high level of development and management in the Columbia, vulnerabilities would still exist, and impacts could still occur in scenarios of natural streamflow changes caused by global climate change. Many of these would be indirect, reflecting the complex relationship between the region and its climate.},

By combining an advanced statistical bias correction method with a dynamical downscaling it constitutes a hybrid technique that yields nearly unbiased, high-resolution, physically consistent, three-dimensional fields that can be used for climate impact studies. The method is based on a prior statistical distribution correction of large-scale global climate model (GCM) 3-dimensional output fields to be taken as boundary forcing of a dynamical regional climate model (RCM). GCM fields are corrected using meteorological reanalyses. We evaluate this methodology over a decadal experiment. The improvement in terms of spatial and temporal variability is discussed against observations for a past period. The biases of the downscaled fields are much lower using this hybrid technique, up to a factor 4 for the mean temperature bias compared to the dynamical downscaling alone without prior bias correction. Precipitation biases are subsequently improved hence offering optimistic perspectives for climate impact studies.},

Methodology/Principal Findings We linked a series of models to investigate responses of California's San Francisco Estuary-Watershed (SFEW) system to two contrasting scenarios of climate change. Model outputs for scenarios of fast and moderate warming are presented as 2010–2099 projections of nine indicators of changing climate, hydrology and habitat quality. Trends of these indicators measure rates of: increasing air and water temperatures, salinity and sea level; decreasing precipitation, runoff, snowmelt contribution to runoff, and suspended sediment concentrations; and increasing frequency of extreme environmental conditions such as water temperatures and sea level beyond the ranges of historical observations. Conclusions/Significance Most of these environmental indicators change substantially over the 21st century, and many would present challenges to natural and managed systems. Adaptations to these changes will require flexible planning to cope with growing risks to humans and the challenges of meeting demands for fresh water and sustaining native biota. Programs of ecosystem rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation in coastal landscapes will be most likely to meet their objectives if they are designed from considerations that include: (1) an integrated perspective that river-estuary systems are influenced by effects of climate change operating on both watersheds and oceans; (2) varying sensitivity among environmental indicators to the uncertainty of future climates; (3) inevitability of biological community changes as responses to cumulative effects of climate change and other drivers of habitat transformations; and (4) anticipation and adaptation to the growing probability of ecosystem regime shifts.},

	abstract = {The potential effects of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River basin are assessed by comparing simulated hydrologic and water resources scenarios derived from downscaled climate simulations of the U. S. Department of Energy/ National Center for Atmospheric Research Parallel Climate Model (PCM) to scenarios driven by observed historical (1950 - 1999) climate. PCM climate scenarios include an ensemble of three 105-year future climate simulations based on projected 'business-as-usual' (BAU) greenhouse gas emissions and a control climate simulation based on static 1995 greenhouse gas concentrations. Downscaled transient temperature and precipitation sequences were extracted from PCM simulations, and were used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity ( VIC) macroscale hydrology model to produce corresponding streamflow sequences. Results for the BAU scenarios were summarized into Periods 1, 2, and 3 ( 2010 - 2039, 2040 - 2069, 2070 - 2098). Average annual temperature changes for the Colorado River basin were 0.5 degreesC warmer for control climate, and 1.0, 1.7, and 2.4 degreesC warmer for Periods 1 - 3, respectively, relative to the historical climate. Basin-average annual precipitation for the control climate was slightly (1\%) less than for observed historical climate, and 3, 6, and 3\% less for future Periods 1 - 3, respectively. Annual runoff in the control run was about 10\% lower than for simulated historical conditions, and 14, 18, and 17\% less for Periods 1 - 3, respectively. Analysis of water management operations using a water management model driven by simulated streamflows showed that streamflows associated with control and future BAU climates would significantly degrade the performance of the water resources system relative to historical conditions, with average total basin storage reduced by 7\% for the control climate and 36, 32 and 40\% for Periods 1 - 3, respectively. Releases from Glen Canyon Dam to the Lower Basin ( mandated by the Colorado River Compact) were met in 80\% of years for the control climate simulation ( versus 92\% in the historical climate simulation), and only in 59 - 75\% of years for the future climate runs. Annual hydropower output was also significantly reduced for the control and future climate simulations. The high sensitivity of reservoir system performance for future climate is a reflection of the fragile equilibrium that now exists in operation of the system, with system demands only slightly less than long-term mean annual inflow.},

	abstract = {A methodology for automated objective circulation pattern (CP) definition and classification is presented based on optimized fuzzy rules. The main goal of the method is to provide a basis (daily classified CPs) for downscaling of precipitation and temperature, which can be done by means of downscaling models with parameters depending on the CP. The CPs are defined using 500 or 700 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Fuzzy rules are defined by the position of high- and low-pressure anomalies. The fuzzy rules are obtained automatically using an optimization of the performance of the classification. For precipitation, the performance of the classification is measured by rainfall frequencies and rainfall amounts conditioned on the CP. So the task is to define wet or dry CPs. For temperature, the deviation from the average long-term annual cycle is used. In this way warm or cold CPs are identified. The performance of the CPs is validated using a split-sampling approach. The presented method produces physically realistic CP definitions. With the help of these definitions the observed (historical) pressure fields can be classified as shown in 2 case studies for regions with different climate conditions: Central Europe (Germany) and the Eastern Mediterranean (Greece).},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to define a method for determining reasonable estimates of rainfall modeled by global circulation models (GCMs) coupled with regional climate models (RCMs). The paper describes and uses two new procedures designed to give confidence in the interpretation of such rainfall estimates. The first of these procedures is the use of circulation patterns (CPs) to define quantile-quantile (Q-Q) transforms between observed and RCM-estimated rainfall (the CPs were derived from sea level pressure (SLP) fields obtained from reanalysis of historical daily weather in a previous study). The Q-Q transforms are derived using two downscaling techniques during a 20 year calibration period and were validated during a 10 year period of observations. The second novel procedure is the use of a double Q-Q transform to estimate the rainfall patterns and amounts from GCM-RCM predictions of SLP and rainfall fields during a future period. This procedure is essential because we find that the CP-dependent rainfall frequency distributions on each block are unexpectedly different from the corresponding historical distributions. The daily rainfall fields compared are recorded on a 25 km grid over the Rhine basin in Germany; the observed daily data are averaged over the grid blocks, and the RCM values have been estimated over the same grid. Annual extremes, recorded on each block during the validation period, of (1) maximum daily rainfall and (2) the lowest 5\% of filtered rainfall were calculated to determine the ability of RCMs to capture rainfall characteristics which are important for hydrological applications. The conclusions are that (1) RCM outputs used here are good at capturing the patterns and rankings of CP-dependent rainfall; (2) CP-dependent downscaling, coupled with the double Q-Q transform, gives good estimates of the rainfall during the validation period; (3) because the RCMs offer future CP-dependent rainfall distributions that are different from the observed distributions, it is judged that these predictions, once modified by the double Q-Q transforms, are hydrologically reasonable; and (4) the climate in the Rhine basin in the future, as modeled by the RCMs, is likely to be wetter than in the past. The results suggest that such future projections may be used with cautious confidence.},

For example, the record-breaking 2003 summer heat wave in Europe has given a glimpse of possible future European climate conditions. Here we use an ensemble of regional climate simulations for the end of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries over Europe to show that frequency, length and intensity changes in warm and cold temperature extremes can be derived to a close approximation from the knowledge of changes in three central statistics, the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the Probability Distribution Function, for which current climate models are better suited. In particular, the effect of the skewness parameter appears to be crucial, especially in the case of cold extremes, since it mostly explains the relative warming of these events compared to the whole distribution. An application of this finding is that the future impacts of extreme heat waves and cold spells on non-climatological variables (e.g., mortality) can be estimated to a first-order approximation from observed time series of daily temperature transformed in order to account for simulated changes in these three statistics.},

	abstract = {The framework of feedback analysis is used to explore the controls on the shape of the probability distribution of global mean surface temperature response to climate forcing. It is shown that ocean heat uptake, which delays and damps the temperature rise, can be represented as a transient negative feedback. This transient negative feedback causes the transient climate change to have a narrower probability distribution than that of the equilibrium climate response (the climate sensitivity). In this sense, climate change is much more predictable than climate sensitivity. The width of the distribution grows gradually over time, a consequence of which is that the larger the climate change being contemplated, the greater the uncertainty is about when that change will be realized. Another consequence of this slow growth is that further efforts to constrain climate sensitivity will be of very limited value for climate projections on societally relevant time scales. Finally, it is demonstrated that the effect on climate predictability of reducing uncertainty in the atmospheric feedbacks is greater than the effect of reducing uncertainty in ocean feedbacks by the same proportion. However, at least at the global scale, the total impact of uncertainty in climate feedbacks is dwarfed by the impact of uncertainty in climate forcing, which in turn is contingent on choices made about future anthropogenic emissions.},

Assembled data include the location of fatalities, age and gender of victims, activity and/or setting of fatalities, and the type of flood events responsible for each fatality report. Because of uncertainties in the number of flood deaths in Louisiana from Hurricane Katrina, these data are not included in the study. Analysis of these data reveals that a majority of fatalities are caused by flash floods. People between the ages of 10 and 29 and {\textgreater}60 yr of age are found to be more vulnerable to floods. Findings reveal that human behavior contributes to flood fatality occurrences. These results also suggest that future structural modifications of flood control designs (e.g., culverts and bridges) may not reduce the number of fatalities nationwide. Spatially, flood fatalities are distributed across the United States, with high-fatality regions observed along the northeast Interstate-95 corridor, the Ohio River valley, and near the Balcones Escarpment in south-central Texas. The unique distributions found are likely driven by both physical vulnerabilities for flooding as well as the social vulnerabilities.},

	abstract = {The performance of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) when coupled to the CCCma third generation general circulation model is evaluated in an AMIP II simulation. Our primary aim is to understand how CLASS processes moisture and to compare model estimates of moisture budget components with observations. The modelled mean annual precipitation and runoff, and their latitudinal structures, compare well with observations although some discrepancies remain in the simulation of regional values of these quantities. The amplitude and phase of the first harmonic of the precipitation annual cycle also compares well with observations although less well over regions of sparse precipitation and/or high topography. In the model, the canopy plays a major role in processing moisture at the land surface indicating the importance of vegetation in climate. The canopy intercepts a large fraction of the precipitation and provides the medium for returning much moisture back to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration. Though important locally, the snow moisture reservoir plays a relatively minor role in the global moisture budget. It acts primarily as a storage and delay mechanism with winter precipitation released to the ground reservoir on melting. The ground moisture reservoir also plays a major role and processes a similar amount of moisture as the canopy, although in a different manner. The globally averaged model runoff compares well with observation-based estimates, although the model partitioning into surface runoff and drainage does not agree particularly well with the single available observation-based estimate. How moisture is processed at the land surface serves as a basis for model intercomparison and for understanding the modelled moisture budget and its variation and changes with climate change. Only the most basic quantities (precipitation, runoff, and partitioning of runoff into surface runoff and drainage) may be compared with observation-based estimates, however, and the establishment of more complete moisture budget remains an important need.},

	abstract = {Changes in the climatology of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture lead also to changes in runoff and streamflow. The potential effects of global warming on the hydrology of 23 major rivers are investigated. The runoff simulated by the Canadian Cetre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled climate model for the current climate is routed through the river system to the river mouth and compared with results for the warmer climate simulated to occur towards the end of the century. Changes in mean discharge, in the amplitude and phase of the annual streamflow cycle, in the annual maximum discharge (the flood) and its standard deviation, and in flow duration curves are all examined. Changes in flood magnitudes for different return periods are estimated using extreme value analysis. In the warmer climate, there is a general decrease in runoff and 15 out of the 23 rivers considered experience a reduction in annual mean discharge (with a median reduction of 32\%). The changes in runoff are not uniform and discharge increases for 8 rivers (with a median increase of 13\%). Middle- and high- latitude rivers typically show marked changes in the amplitude and phase of their annual cycle associated with a decrease in snowfall and an earlier spring melt in the warmer climate. Low-latitude rivers exhibit changes in mean discharge but modest changes in their annual cycle. The analysis of annual flood magnitudes show that 17 out of 23 rivers experience a reduction in mean annual flood (a median reduction of 20\%). Changes in now duration curves are used to characterize the different kinds of behavior exhibited by different groups of rivers. Differences in the regional distribution of simulated precipitation and runoff for the control simulation currently limit the application of the approach. The inferred hydrological changes are, nevertheless, plausible and consistent responses to simulated changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration and indicate the kinds of hydrological changes that could occur in a warmer climate.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the implications of climate change for global river flood risk. It is based on the estimation of flood frequency relationships at a grid resolution of 0.5 × 0.5°, using a global hydrological model with climate scenarios derived from 21 climate models, together with projections of future population. Four indicators of the flood hazard are calculated; change in the magnitude and return period of flood peaks, flood-prone population and cropland exposed to substantial change in flood frequency, and a generalised measure of regional flood risk based on combining frequency curves with generic flood damage functions. Under one climate model, emissions and socioeconomic scenario (HadCM3 and SRES A1b), in 2050 the current 100-year flood would occur at least twice as frequently across 40 \% of the globe, approximately 450 million flood-prone people and 430 thousand km2 of flood-prone cropland would be exposed to a doubling of flood frequency, and global flood risk would increase by approximately 187 \% over the risk in 2050 in the absence of climate change. There is strong regional variability (most adverse impacts would be in Asia), and considerable variability between climate models. In 2050, the range in increased exposure across 21 climate models under SRES A1b is 31–450 million people and 59 to 430 thousand km2 of cropland, and the change in risk varies between −9 and +376 \%. The paper presents impacts by region, and also presents relationships between change in global mean surface temperature and impacts on the global flood hazard. There are a number of caveats with the analysis; it is based on one global hydrological model only, the climate scenarios are constructed using pattern-scaling, and the precise impacts are sensitive to some of the assumptions in the definition and application.},

The dominant paradigm in climate science, of an ensemble sampled from a distribution centred on the truth, is contrasted with the paradigm of a statistically indistinguishable ensemble, which has been more commonly adopted in other fields. This latter interpretation (which gives rise to a natural probabilistic interpretation of ensemble output) leads to new insights about the evaluation of ensemble performance. Using the well-known rank histogram method of analysis, we find that the CMIP3 ensemble generally provides a rather good sample under the statistically indistinguishable paradigm, although it appears marginally over-dispersive and exhibits some modest biases. These results contrast strongly with the incompatibility of the ensemble with the truth-centred paradigm. Thus, our analysis provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation, with empirical support, for the probabilistic use of multi-model ensembles in climate research.},

	abstract = {The configuration and performance of a new global atmosphere and land model for climate research developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are presented. The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2-LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
One AM2-LM2 integration was performed according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2-LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2 LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation.
An ensemble of 10 AM2-LM2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO. In general, AM2-LM2 produces a realistic simulation of the anomalies in tropical precipitation and extratropical circulation that are associated with ENSO.},

	abstract = {A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951\&\#8211;2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70\% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901\&\#8211;2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901\&\#8211;1950, 1951\&\#8211;1978 and 1979\&\#8211;2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

	title = {Rainfall downscaling in an alpine watershed applying a multiresolution approach},
	volume = {108},
	abstract = {[1] Distributed hydrological modeling in alpine watersheds needs high-resolution (similar to1 km in space, 1 h in time) rainfall input. Spatial resolution of operational numerical weather forecast or regional climate models is coarser by at least one order of magnitude. Stochastic downscaling of meteorological model output is the appropriate way to bridge this scale gap. This study examines radar data in an orographically complex area in the southern European Alps by multiplicative multiresolution decomposition. Multiresolution rainfall fluctuations exhibit simple scaling characteristics. This result motivates the implementation of a spatial downscaling model, an example of an anisotropic microcanonical multiplicative random cascade, that is applied and evaluated. Necessity and skill of downscaling is illustrated by hydrological modeling of four heavy precipitation events in an Alpine watershed ( total area of 2627 km(2)) with the grid- based model WaSiM-ETH. Downscaling of rainfall fields with 16 km grid spacing to fields with 1 km grid spacing improves the simulated event-mean runoff by 5-10\% and the peak runoff by up to 20\%.},

	abstract = {[1] In this study, a statistical downscaling model based on singular value decomposition was applied to estimate the monthly mean temperature field in Japan for January and July. The regression model estimated surface air temperature in Japan from upper air temperature in east Asia with root-mean-square errors of around 1.0degrees C for an independent verification period. The method was applied to the output of a CO2 transient run of NCAR-CSM, and the result was compared with the output of NCAR-RegCM2.5 nested in CSM. The statistical model reproduced the spatial distribution of the temperature more realistically than the CSM output. In January the results corresponded well between the models except that the climate simulated by RegCM was generally cooler than that estimated using the statistical method mainly due to the unrealistic RegCM topography. In July the results did not correspond well between the methods, since the climate is more complex and difficult to be estimated solely from the upper air temperature field. Temperature rise from 1CO(2) climate to 2CO(2) climate was larger in RegCM than in the statistical method for both months reflecting the influence of sea surface temperature rise. It was concluded that this statistical downscaling method can be applied to estimate the January mean temperature in Japan, although other predictor variables such as sea surface temperature should be included to improve the estimation in July.},

	abstract = {Sponsored by the Committee on Technical Advancement of ASCE Adapting Infrastructure and Civil Engineering Practice to a Changing Climate presents an accurate discussion of the potential significance of climate change to engineering practice. Although considerable evidence indicates that the climate is changing, significant uncertainty exists regarding the location, timing, and magnitude of this change over the lifetime of infrastructure. Practicing engineers are faced with the dilemma of balancing future needs for engineered infrastructure with the risks posed by the effects of climate change on long-term engineering projects. The gap between climate science and engineering practice somehow must be bridged. This report identifies the technical requirements and civil engineering challenges raised by adaptation to a changing climate. Topics include: review of climate science for engineering practice; incorporating climate science into engineering practice; civil engineering sectors that might be affected by climate change; needs for research, development, and demonstration projects; and summary, conclusions, and recommendations. Three appendixes illustrate different engineering approaches to assessing or preparing for climate change. Practitioners, researchers, educators, and students of civil engineering, as well as government officials and allied professionals, will be fascinated by this discussion of the trade-offs between the expenses of increasing system reliability and the potential costs and consequences of failure to future generations.},

Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

The statistical framework for this multiscale characterization is cascade based and offers a parsimonious parameterization, which can be used in future studies for the purposes of stochastically downscaling rainfall fields. Sequences of radar- derived rainfall maps provide data with which to characterize the multiscale statistical structure and variability of the rainfall. In this case study, rainfall falling at higher topographic elevations was shown to be more intermittent and more organized than rainfall at lower elevations. This trend is contrary to previous studies analyzing the multiscale structure of orographic rainfall and is argued to be the direct result of differing meteorological factors for this type of storm such as the presence of warm rain processes and leeside orographic forcing.},

The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.},

	abstract = {Climate predictions from four state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) were used to assess the hydrologic sensitivity to climate change of nine large, continental river basins (Amazon, Amur, Mackenzie, Mekong, Mississippi, Severnaya Dvina, Xi, Yellow, Yenisei). The four climate models (HCCPR-CM2, HCCPR-CM3, MPI-ECHAM4, and DOE-PCM3) all predicted transient climate response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, and incorporated modern land surface parameterizations. Model-predicted monthly average precipitation and temperature changes were downscaled to the river basin level using model increments (transient minus control) to adjust for GCM bias. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (MHM) was used to calculate the corresponding changes in hydrologic fluxes (especially streamflow and evapotranspiration) and moisture storages. Hydrologic model simulations were performed for decades centered on 2025 and 2045. In addition, a sensitivity study was performed in which temperature and precipitation were increased independently by 2 degreesC and 10\%, respectively, during each of four seasons. All GCMs predict a warming for all nine basins, with the greatest warming predicted to occur during the winter months in the highest latitudes. Precipitation generally increases, but the monthly precipitation signal varies more between the models than does temperature. The largest changes in the hydrological cycle are predicted for the snow-dominated basins of mid to higher latitudes. This results in part from the greater amount of warming predicted for these regions, but more importantly, because of the important role of snow in the water balance. Because the snow pack integrates the effects of climate change over a period of months, the largest changes occur in early to mid spring when snow melt occurs. The climate change responses are somewhat different for the coldest snow dominated basins than for those with more transitional snow regimes. In the coldest basins, the response to warming is an increase of the spring streamflow peak, whereas for the transitional basins spring runoff decreases. Instead, the transitional basins have large increases in winter streamflows. The hydrological response of most tropical and mid-latitude basins to the warmer and somewhat wetter conditions predicted by the GCMs is a reduction in annual streamflow, although again, considerable disagreement exists among the different GCMs. In contrast, for the high-latitude basins increases in annual flow volume are predicted in most cases.},

We explore the implications of a probabilistic end-to-end risk-based framework for climate impacts assessment, using the example of water resources in the Thames River, UK. We show that a probabilistic approach provides more informative results that enable the potential risk of impacts to be quantified, but that details of the risks are dependent on the approach used in the analysis.},

	title = {An evaluation of statistical and dynamical techniques for downscaling local climate},
	volume = {12},
	abstract = {An assessment is made of downscaling estimates of screen temperature and precipitation observed at 976 European stations during 1983-94. A statistical downscaling technique, in which local values are inferred from observed atmospheric predictor variables, is compared against two dynamical downscaling techniques, based on the use of the screen temperature or precipitation simulated at the nearest grid point in integrations of two climate models. In one integration a global general circulation model (GCM) is constrained to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation over the period of interest, while the second involves a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) nested inside the GCM. The dynamical and statistical methods are compared in terms of the correlation between the estimated and observed time series of monthly anomalies. For estimates of temperature a high degree of skill is found, especially over western, central and northern Europe; for precipitation skill is lower (average correlations ranging from 0.4 in summer to 0.7 in winter). Overall, the dynamical and statistical methods show similar levels of skill, although the statistical method is better for summertime estimates of temperature while the dynamical methods give slightly better estimates of wintertime precipitation. In general, therefore, the skill with which present-day surface climate anomalies can be derived from atmospheric observations is not improved by using the sophisticated calculations of subgrid-scale processes made in climate models rather than simple empirical relationships. It does not necessarily follow that statistical and dynamical downscaling estimates of changes in surface climate will also possess equal skill. By the above measure the two dynamical techniques possess approximately equal skill; however, they art: also compared by assessing errors in the mean and variance of monthly values and errors in the simulated distributions of daily values. Such errors arise from systematic biases in the models plus the effect of unresolved local forcings. For precipitation the results show that the RCM offers clear benefits relative to the GCM: the simulated variability of both daily and monthly values, although lower than observed, is much more realistic than in the CCM because the finer grid reduces the amount of spatial smoothing implicit in the use of grid-box variables. The climatological means are also simulated better in the winter half of the year because the RCM captures some of the mesoscale detail present in observed distributions. The temperature fields contain a mesoscale orographic signal that is skillfully reproduced by the RCM; however, this is not a source of increased skill relative to the GCM since elevation biases can be largely removed using simple empirical corrections based on spatially averaged lapse rates. Nevertheless, the average skill of downscaled climatological mean temperature values is higher in the RCM in nearly all months. The additional skill arises from better resolution of local physiographical features, especially coastlines, and also from the dynamical effects of higher resolution, which generally act to reduce the large-scale systematic biases in the simulated values. Both models tend to overestimate the variability of both daily and monthly mean temperature. On average the RCM is more skillful in winter but less skillful in summer, due to excessive drying of the soil over central and southern Europe. The downscaling scores for monthly means are compared against scores obtained by using a predictor variable consisting of observations from the nearest station to the predictand station. In general the downscaling scores are significantly worse than those obtained from adjacent stations, indicating that there remains considerable scope for refining the techniques in future. In the case of dynamical downscaling progress can be made by reducing systematic errors through improvements in the representation of physical processes and increased resolution; the prospects for improving statistical downscaling will depend on the availability of the observational data needed to provide longer calibration time series and/or a wider range of predictor variables.},

	abstract = {Climate change impact assessment requires data at the spatial and the temporal resolution at which impacts occur. The outputs of the current global climate models (GCMs) cannot be used directly in the development of desired climate change scenarios due to their coarse resolution. Artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate statistics (MST) models were adapted to derive changes of site precipitation and temperature characteristics in a comparative study of their potential in downscaling GCM outputs. They were calibrated and verified using observed site temperature and precipitation over New Zealand and circulation variables from the National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis. Subsequently, the models were used to derive changes of mean monthly precipitation and temperature characteristics from circulation variables projected in a transient climate change experiment performed by the Hadley Centre Global Climate Model (HadCM2). HadCM2 validated well with respect to NCEP reanalysis for its 'present climate' simulation. The predicted changes in seasonal mean sea level pressure fields over the 'New Zealand region' include intensified westerly flow particularly in winter. Therefore, the HadCM2 outputs contain information that can be used to derive localized climate change characteristics. Both downscaling models capture similar general patterns of change from the same GCM output, although they show substantial differences in localized characteristics, particularly for precipitation. The MST model suggests greater warming than the ANN model but both show larger temperature rises in summer and spring than in other seasons. Precipitation changes have marked spatial variation in their magnitude and direction; although by 2070-2099 more sites show precipitation increases than decreases, except for spring, and precipitation increases are more common in the North Island than the South Island. This intercomparison of two downscaling methods demonstrates an important source of uncertainty in regional climate change scenarios in addition to differing regional responses of GCMs. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Statistical and dynamical downscaling predictions of changes in surface temperature and precipitation for 2080-2100, relative to pre-industrial conditions, are compared at 976 European observing sites, for January and July. Two dynamical downscaling methods are considered, involving the use of surface temperature or precipitation simulated at the nearest grid point in a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (GCM) of resolution similar to 300 km and a 50 km regional climate model (RCM) nested inside the GCM. The statistical method (STAT) is based on observed linear regression relationships between surface temperature or precipitation and a range of atmospheric predictor variables. The three methods are equally plausible a priori, in the sense that they estimate present-day natural variations with equal skill. For temperature, differences between the RCM and GCM predictions are quite small. Larger differences occur between STAT and the dynamical predictions. For precipitation, there is a wide spread between all three methods. Differences between the RCM and GCM are increased by the meso-scale detail present in the RCM. Uncertainties in the downscaling predictions are investigated by using the STAT method to estimate the grid point changes simulated by the GCM, based on regression relationships trained using simulated rather than observed values of the predictor and the predictand variables (i.e. STAT\_SIM). In most areas the temperature changes predicted by STAT\_SIM and the GCM itself are similar, indicating that the statistical relationships trained from present climate anomalies remain valid in the perturbed climate. However, STAT\_SIM underestimates the surface warming in areas where advective predictors are important predictors of natural variability but not of climate change. For precipitation, STAT\_SIM estimates the simulated changes with lower skill, especially in January when increases in simulated precipitation related to a moister atmosphere are not captured. This occurs because moisture is rarely a strong enough predictor of natural variability to be included in the specification equation. The predictor/predictand relationships found in the GCM do not always match those found in observations. In January, the link between surface and lower tropospheric temperature is too strong. This is also true in July, when the links between precipitation and various atmospheric predictors are also too strong. These biases represent a likely source of error in both dynamical and statistical downscaling predictions. For example, simulated reductions in precipitation over southern Europe in summer may be too large. (C) British Crown Copyright 2000.},

Much of the mountain West has experienced declines in spring snowpack, especially since midcentury, despite increases in winter precipitation in many places. Analysis and modeling show that climatic trends are the dominant factor, not changes in land use, forest canopy, or other factors. The largest decreases have occurred where winter temperatures are mild, especially in the Cascade Mountains and northern California. In most mountain ranges, relative declines grow from minimal at ridgetop to substantial at snow line.

	title = {Predicting regional climate change: living with uncertainty},
	volume = {23},
	abstract = {Regional climate prediction is not an insoluble problem, but it is a problem characterized by inherent uncertainty. There are two sources of this uncertainty: the unpredictability of the climatic and global systems. The climate system is rendered unpredictable by deterministic chaos; the global system renders climate prediction uncertain through the unpredictability of the external forcings imposed on the climate system. It is commonly inferred from the differences between climate models on regional scales that the models are deficient, but climate system unpredictability is such that this inference is premature; the differences are due to an unresolved combination of climate system unpredictability and model deficiencies. Since model deficiencies are discussed frequently and the two sources of inherent uncertainty are discussed only rarely, this review considers the implications of climatic and global system unpredictability for regional climate prediction. Consequently we regard regional climate prediction as a cascade of uncertainty, rather than as a single result process sullied by model deficiencies. We suggest three complementary methodological approaches: (1) the use of multiple forcing scenarios to cope with global system unpredictability; (2) the use of ensembles to cope with climate system unpredictability; and (3) the consideration of the entire response of the climate system to cope with the nature of climate change. We understand regional climate change in terms of changes in the general circulations of the atmosphere and oceans; so we illustrate the role of uncertainty in the task of regional climate prediction with the behaviour of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. In conclusion we discuss the implications of the uncertainties in regional climate prediction for research into the impacts of climate change, and we recognize the role of feedbacks in complicating the relatively simple cascade of uncertainties presented here.},

Leaving riparian buffers can decrease the magnitude of stream temperature increases and changes to riparian microclimate, but substantial warming has been observed for streams within both unthinned and partial retention buffers. A range of studies has demonstrated that streams may or may not cool after flowing from clearings into shaded environments, and further research is required in relation to the factors controlling downstream cooling. Further research is also required on riparian microclimate and its responses to harvesting, the influences of surface/subsurface water exchange on stream and bed temperature regimes, biological implications of temperature changes in headwater streams (both on site and downstream), and methods for quantifying shade and its influence on radiation inputs to streams and riparian zones.},

	abstract = {AbstractContinental-domain assessments of climate change impacts on water resources typically rely on statistically downscaled climate model outputs to force hydrologic models at a finer spatial resolution. This study examines the effects of four statistical downscaling methods [bias-corrected constructed analog (BCCA), bias-corrected spatial disaggregation applied at daily (BCSDd) and monthly scales (BCSDm), and asynchronous regression (AR)] on retrospective hydrologic simulations using three hydrologic models with their default parameters (the Community Land Model, version 4.0; the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, version 4.1.2; and the Precipitation–Runoff Modeling System, version 3.0.4) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). Biases of hydrologic simulations forced by statistically downscaled climate data relative to the simulation with observation-based gridded data are presented. Each statistical downscaling method produces different meteorological portrayals including precipitation amount, wet-day frequency, and the energy input (i.e., shortwave radiation), and their interplay affects estimations of precipitation partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff, extreme runoff, and hydrologic states (i.e., snow and soil moisture). The analyses show that BCCA underestimates annual precipitation by as much as −250 mm, leading to unreasonable hydrologic portrayals over the CONUS for all models. Although the other three statistical downscaling methods produce a comparable precipitation bias ranging from −10 to 8 mm across the CONUS, BCSDd severely overestimates the wet-day fraction by up to 0.25, leading to different precipitation partitioning compared to the simulations with other downscaled data. Overall, the choice of downscaling method contributes to less spread in runoff estimates (by a factor of 1.5–3) than the choice of hydrologic model with use of the default parameters if BCCA is excluded.},

	abstract = {Previous reports based on climate change scenarios have suggested that California will be subjected to increased wintertime and decreased summertime streamflow. Due to the uncertainty of projections in future climate, a new range of potential climatological future temperature shifts and precipitation ratios is applied to the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model and Anderson Snow Model in order to determine hydrologic sensitivities. Two general circulation models (GCMs) were used in this analysis: one that is warm and wet (HadCM2 run 1) and one that is cool and dry (PCM run B06.06), relative to the GCM projections for California that were part of the Third Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change. A set of specified incremental temperature shifts from 1.5degreesC to 5.0degreesC and precipitation ratios from 0.70 to 1.30 were also used as input to the snow and soil moisture accounting models, providing for additional scenarios (e.g., warm/dry, cool/wet). Hydrologic calculations were performed for a set of California river basins that extend from the coastal mountains and Sierra Nevada northern region to the southern Sierra Nevada region; these were applied to a water allocation analysis in a companion paper. Results indicate that for all snow-producing cases, a larger proportion of the streamflow volume will occur earlier in the year. The amount and timing is dependent on the characteristics of each basin, particularly the elevation. Increased temperatures lead to a higher freezing line, therefore less snow accumulation and increased melting below the freezing height. The hydrologic response varies for each scenario, and the resulting solution set provides bounds to the range of possible change in streamflow, snowmelt, snow water equivalent, and the change in the magnitude of annual high flows. An important result that appears for all snowmelt driven runoff basins, is that late winter snow accumulation decreases by 50 percent toward the end of this century.},

	issn = {0894-8755},
	abstract = {The annual energy budget of the Arctic Ocean is characterized by a net heat loss at the air-sea interface that is balanced by oceanic heat transport into the Arctic. Two 150-yr simulations (1950-2099) of a global climate model are used to examine how this balance might change if atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase. One is a control simulation for the present climate with constant 1950 atmospheric composition, and the other is a transient experiment with observed GHGs from 1950 to 1990 and 0.5\% annual compounded increases of CO2 after 1990. For the present climate the model agrees well with observations of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, atmospheric advective energy transport into the Arctic, and surface air temperature. It also simulates the seasonal cycle and summer increase of cloud cover and the seasonal cycle of sea ice cover. In addition, the changes in high-latitude surface air temperature and sea ice cover in the GHG experiment are consistent with observed changes during the last 40 years.
Relative to the control, the last 50-yr period of the GHG experiment indicates that even though the net annual incident solar radiation at the surface decreases by 4.6 W m(-2) (because of greater cloud cover and increased cloud optical depth), the absorbed solar radiation increases by 2.8 W m(-2) (because of less sea ice). Increased cloud cover and warmer air also cause increased downward thermal radiation at the surface so that the net radiation into the ocean increases by 5.0 W m(-2). The annual increase in radiation into the ocean, however, is compensated by larger increases in sensible and latent heat fluxes out of the ocean. Although the net energy loss from the ocean surface increases by 0.8 W m(-2), this is less than the interannual variability, and the increase may not indicate a long-term trend.
The seasonal cycle of heat fluxes is significantly enhanced. The downward surface heat flux increases in summer (maximum of 19 W m(-2), or 23\% in June) while the upward heat flux increases in winter (maximum of 16 W m(-2), or 28\% in November). The increased downward flux in summer is due to a combination of increases in absorbed solar and thermal radiation and smaller losses of sensible and latent heat. The increased heat loss in winter is due to increased sensible and latent heat fluxes, which in turn are due to reduced sea ice cover. On the other hand, the seasonal cycle of surface air temperature is damped, as there is a large increase in winter temperature but little change in summer. The changes that occur in the various quantities exhibit spatial variability, with the changes being generally larger in coastal areas and at the ice margins.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {The Pacific Northwest (PNW) regional assessment is an integrated examination of the consequences of natural climate variability and projected future climate change for the natural and human systems of the region. The assessment currently focuses on four sectors: hydrology/water resources, forests and forestry, aquatic ecosystems, and coastal activities. The assessment begins by identifying and elucidating the natural patterns of climate variability in the PNW on interannual to decadal timescales. The pathways through which these climate variations are manifested and the resultant impacts on the natural and human systems of the region are investigated. Knowledge of these pathways allows an analysis of the potential impacts of future climate change, as defined by IPCC climate change scenarios. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of hydrology and water resources to climate variability and change. We focus on the Columbia River Basin, which covers approximately 75 percent of the PNW and is the basis for the dominant water resources system of the PNW. The water resources system of the Columbia River is sensitive to climate variability, especially with respect to drought. Management inertia and the lack of a centralized authority coordinating all uses of the resource impede adaptability to drought and optimization of water distribution. Climate change projections suggest exacerbated conditions of conflict between users as a result of low summertime streamflow conditions. An understanding of the patterns and consequences of regional climate variability is crucial to developing an adequate response to future changes in climate.},

Any of the resulting 143 clusters represents a particular combination of geostrophic wind components and vertical temperature gradient. For each cluster, a highly resolved steady-state wind field is simulated with a non- hydrostatic mesoscale model.

	abstract = {AbstractThe assessment of climate change impacts on water resources involves several methodological decisions, including choices of global climate models (GCMs), emission scenarios, downscaling techniques, and hydrologic modeling approaches. Among these, hydrologic model structure selection and parameter calibration are particularly relevant and usually have a strong subjective component. The goal of this research is to improve understanding of the role of these decisions on the assessment of the effects of climate change on hydrologic processes. The study is conducted in three basins located in the Colorado headwaters region, using four different hydrologic model structures [PRMS, VIC, Noah LSM, and Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP)]. To better understand the role of parameter estimation, model performance and projected hydrologic changes (i.e., changes in the hydrology obtained from hydrologic models due to climate change) are compared before and after calibration with the University of Arizona shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm. Hydrologic changes are examined via a climate change scenario where the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) change signal is used to perturb the boundary conditions of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model configured at 4-km resolution. Substantial intermodel differences (i.e., discrepancies between hydrologic models) in the portrayal of climate change impacts on water resources are demonstrated. Specifically, intermodel differences are larger than the mean signal from the CCSM–WRF climate scenario examined, even after the calibration process. Importantly, traditional single-objective calibration techniques aimed to reduce errors in runoff simulations do not necessarily improve intermodel agreement (i.e., same outputs from different hydrologic models) in projected changes of some hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration or snowpack.},

	abstract = {In 1997, during the late stages of production of NCEP–NCAR Global Reanalysis (GR), exploration of a regional reanalysis project was suggested by the GR project's Advisory Committee, “particularly if the RDAS [Regional Data Assimilation System] is significantly better than the global reanalysis at capturing the regional hydrological cycle, the diurnal cycle and other important features of weather and climate variability.” Following a 6-yr development and production effort, NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) project was completed in 2004, and data are now available to the scientific community. Along with the use of the NCEP Eta model and its Data Assimilation System (at 32-km–45-layer resolution with 3-hourly output), the hallmarks of the NARR are the incorporation of hourly assimilation of precipitation, which leverages a comprehensive precipitation analysis effort, the use of a recent version of the Noah land surface model, and the use of numerous other datasets that are additional or improved compared to the GR. Following the practice applied to NCEP's GR, the 25-yr NARR retrospective production period (1979–2003) is augmented by the construction and daily execution of a system for near-real-time continuation of the NARR, known as the Regional Climate Data Assimilation System (R-CDAS). Highlights of the NARR results are presented: precipitation over the continental United States (CONUS), which is seen to be very near the ingested analyzed precipitation; fits of tropospheric temperatures and winds to rawinsonde observations; and fits of 2-m temperatures and 10-m winds to surface station observations. The aforementioned fits are compared to those of the NCEP–Department of Energy (DOE) Global Reanalysis (GR2). Not only have the expectations cited above been fully met, but very substantial improvements in the accuracy of temperatures and winds compared to that of GR2 are achieved throughout the troposphere. Finally, the numerous datasets produced are outlined and information is provided on the data archiving and present data availability.},

The proposed rainfall model is shown to successfully reproduce the statistical behavior of individual storms as well as, and in particular, the statistical behavior of annual maxima. In contrast, a model based on a gamma distribution for rainfall intensity substantially underestimates the absolute values of extreme events and does not correctly reproduce their scaling behavior. Similarly, a model based on self-similar random cascade (as opposed to the bounded cascade) substantially overestimates the extreme events.},

	abstract = {Ensemble experiments with a global coupled climate model are performed for the twentieth century with time-evolving solar, greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol (direct effect), and ozone (tropospheric and stratospheric) forcing. Observed global warming in the twentieth century occurred in two periods, one in the early twentieth century from about the early 1900s to the 1940s, and one later in the century from, roughly, the late 1960s to the end of the century. The model's response requires the combination of solar and anthropogenic forcing to approximate the early twentieth-century warming, while the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gases is dominant for the response in the late twentieth century, confirming previous studies. Of particular interest here is the model's amplification of solar forcing when this acts in combination with anthropogenic forcing. This difference is traced to the fact that solar forcing is more spatially heterogeneous (i.e., acting most strongly in areas where sunlight reaches the surface) while greenhouse gas forcing is more spatially uniform. Consequently, solar forcing is subject to coupled regional feedbacks involving the combination of temperature gradients, circulation regimes, and clouds. The magnitude of these feedbacks depends on the climate's base state. Over relatively cloud-free oceanic regions in the subtropics, the enhanced solar forcing produces greater evaporation. More moisture then converges into the precipitation convergence zones, intensifying the regional monsoon and Hadley and Walker circulations, causing cloud reductions over the subtropical ocean regions, and, hence, more solar input. An additional response to solar forcing in northern summer is an enhancement of the meridional temperature gradients due to greater solar forcing over land regions that contribute to stronger West African and South Asian monsoons. Since the greenhouse gases are more spatially uniform, such regional circulation feedbacks are not as strong. These regional responses are most evident when the solar forcing occurs in concert with increased greenhouse gas forcing. The net effect of enhanced solar forcing in the early twentieth century is to produce larger solar-induced increases of tropical precipitation when calculated as a residual than for early century solar-only forcing, even though the size of the imposed solar forcing is the same. As a consequence, overall precipitation increases in the early twentieth century in the Asian monsoon regions are greater than late century increases, qualitatively consistent with observed trends in all-India rainfall. Similar effects occur in West Africa, the tropical Pacific, and the Southern Ocean tropical convergence zones.},

Some of the recent models have reproduced results previously reported in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report, such as a greater frequency of extreme warm days and lower frequency of extreme cold days associated with a warmer mean climate, a decrease in diurnal temperature range associated with higher nighttime temperatures, increased precipitation intensity, midcontinent summer drying, decreasing daily variability of surface temperature in winter, and increasing variability of northern midlatitude summer surface temperatures. This reconfirmation of previous results gives an increased confidence in the credibility of the models, though agreement among models does not guarantee those changes will occur. New results since the IPCC Second Assessment Report indicate a possible increase of extreme heat stress events in a warmer climate, an increase of cooling degree days and decrease in heating degree days, an increase of precipitation extremes such that there is a decrease in return periods for 20-yr extreme precipitation events, and more detailed analyses of possible changes in 20-yr return values for extreme maximum and minimum temperatures. Additionally, recent studies are now addressing interannual and synoptic time and space scale processes that affect weather and climate extremes, such as tropical cyclones, El Nino effects, and extratropical storms.

The four models are the Climate System Model (CSM), the Parallel Climate Model (PCM), the PCM/CSM Transition Model (PCTM), and the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). The hypothesis is posed that models with similar atmospheric model components should show a similar globally averaged dynamically coupled response to increasing CO2 in spite of different ocean, sea ice, and land formulations. Conversely, models with different atmospheric components should be most different in terms of the coupled globally averaged response. The two models with the same atmosphere and sea ice but different ocean components ( PCM and PCTM) have the most similar response to increasing CO2, followed closely by CSM with comparable atmosphere and different ocean and sea ice from either PCM or PCTM. The fourth model, CCSM, has a different response from the other three and, in particular, is different from PCTM in spite of having the same ocean and sea ice but different atmospheric model component. These results support the hypothesis that, to a greater degree than the other components, the atmospheric model "manages'' the relevant global feedbacks including sea ice albedo, water vapor, and clouds. The atmospheric model also affects the meridional overturning circulation in the ocean, as well as the ocean heat uptake characteristics. This is due to changes in surface fluxes of heat and freshwater that affect surface density in the ocean. For global sensitivity measures, the ocean, sea ice, and land surface play secondary roles, even though differences in these components can be important for regional climate changes.},

	abstract = {Ensemble simulations are run with a global coupled climate model employing five forcing agents that influence the time evolution of globally averaged surface air temperature during the twentieth century. Two are natural ( volcanoes and solar) and the others are anthropogenic [e.g., greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone (stratospheric and tropospheric), and direct effect of sulfate aerosols]. In addition to the five individual forcing experiments, an additional eight sets are performed with the forcings in various combinations. The late-twentieth-century warming can only be reproduced in the model with anthropogenic forcing ( mainly GHGs), while the early twentieth-century warming is mainly caused by natural forcing in the model ( mainly solar). However, the signature of globally averaged temperature at any time in the twentieth century is a direct consequence of the sum of the forcings. The similarity of the response to the forcings on decadal and interannual time scales is tested by performing a principal component analysis of the 13 ensemble mean globally averaged temperature time series. A significant portion of the variance of the reconstructed time series can be retained in residual calculations compared to the original single and combined forcing runs. This demonstrates that the statistics of the variances for decadal and interannual time-scale variability in the forced simulations are similar to the response from a residual calculation. That is, the variance statistics of the response of globally averaged temperatures in the forced runs are additive since they can be reproduced in the responses calculated as a residual from other combined forcing runs.},

	abstract = {The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) involves study and intercomparison of multimodel simulations of present and future climate. The simulations of the future use idealized forcing in which CO, increase is compounded 1\% yr(-1) until it doubles (near year 70) with global coupled models that contain, typically, components representing atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface. Results from CMIP diagnostic sub-projects were presented at the Second CMIP Workshop held at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, in September 2003. Significant progress in diagnosing and understanding results from global coupled models has been made since the time of the First CMIP Workshop in Melbourne, Australia, in 1998. For example, the issue of flux adjustment is slowly fading as more and more models obtain stable multicentury surface climates without them. El Nino variability, usually about half the observed amplitude in the previous generation of coupled models, is now more accurately simulated in the present generation of global coupled models, though there are still biases in simulating the patterns of maximum variability. Typical resolutions of atmospheric component models contained in coupled models are now usually around 2.5degrees latitude-longitude, with the ocean components often having about twice the atmospheric model resolution, with even higher resolution in the equatorial Tropics. Some new-generation coupled models have atmospheric resolutions of around 1.5degrees latitude - longitude. Modeling groups now routinely run the CMIP control and 1\% CO2 simulations in addition to twentieth- and twenty-first-century climate simulations with a variety of forcings [e.g., volcanoes, solar variability, anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, ozone, and greenhouse gases, with the anthropogenic forcings for future climate as well]. However, persistent systematic errors noted in previous generations of global coupled models are still present in the current generation (e.g., overextensive equatorial Pacific cold tongue, double ITCZ). This points to the next challenge for the global coupled climate modeling community. Planning and commencement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) has prompted rapid coupled model development, which is leading to an expanded CMIP-like activity to collect and analyze results for the control, 1\% CO2, and twentieth-, twenty-first, and twenty-second-century simulations performed for the AR4. The international climate community is encouraged to become involved in this analysis effort.},

The SDS method is based on the circulation pattern classification technique in combination with stochastic generation of daily time series of temperature and precipitation. It uses daily values of 700 mbar geopotential heights as the large-scale circulation variable. The regional climate model is driven by initial and lateral boundary conditions from the GCM, The RegCM2 exhibited greater spatial variability than the SDS method for change in both temperature and precipitation. The SDS method produced a seasonal cycle of temperature change with a much larger amplitude than that of the RegCM2 or the GCM. Daily variability of temperature mainly decreased for both downscaling methods and the GCM. Changes in mean daily precipitation varied between SDS and RegCM2. The RegCM2 simulated both increases and decreases in the probability of precipitation, while the SDS method produced only increases. We explore possible dynamical and physical reasons for the differences in the scenarios produced by the two methods and the GCM.},

Here, El Nino-like phenomena are compared in ten sensitivity experiments using two recent global coupled models. These models have various combinations of horizontal and vertical ocean resolution, ocean physics. and atmospheric model resolution. It is demonstrated that the lower the value of the ocean background vertical diffusivity, the greater the amplitude of EI Nine variability which is related primarily to a sharper equatorial thermocline. Among models with low background vertical diffusivity, stronger equatorial zonal wind stress is associated with relatively higher amplitude El Nine variability along with more realistic east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient alone the equator. The SST seasonal cycle in the eastern tropical Pacific has too much of a semiannual component with a double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in all experiments. and thus does not affect. nor is it affected by, the amplitude of El Nine variability. Systematic errors affecting the spatial variability of El Nine in the experiments are characterized by the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue regime extending too far westward into the warm pool. The time scales of interannual variability (as represented by time series of Nino3 SSTs) show significant power in the 3-4 year ENSO band and 2-2.5 year tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO) band in the model experiments. The TBO periods in the models agree well with the observations, while the ENSO periods are near the short end of the range of 3-6 years observed during the period 1950-94. The close association between interannual variability of equatorial eastern Pacific SSTs and large-scale SST patterns is represented by significant correlations between Nino3 time series and the PC time series of the first EOFs of near-global SSTs in the models and observations.},

	abstract = {Our central goal is to determine the importance of including both mean and variability changes in climate change scenarios in an agricultural context. By adapting and applying a stochastic weather generator, we first tested the sensitivity of the CERES-Wheat model to combinations of mean and variability changes of temperature and precipitation for two locations in Kansas. With a 2°C increase in temperature with daily (and interannual) variance doubled, yields were further reduced compared to the mean only change. In contrast, the negative effects of the mean temperature increase were greatly ameliorated by variance decreased by one-half. Changes for precipitation are more complex, since change in variability naturally attends change in mean, and constraining the stochastic generator to mean change only is highly artificial. The crop model is sensitive to precipitation variance increases with increased mean and variance decreases with decreased mean. With increased mean precipitation and a further increase in variability Topeka (where wheat cropping is not very moisture limited) experiences decrease in yield after an initial increase from the 'mean change only’ case. At Goodland Kansas, a moisture-limited site where summer fallowing is practiced, yields are decreased with decreased precipitation, but are further decreased when variability is further reduced. The range of mean and variability changes to which the crop model is sensitive are within the range of changes found in regional climate modeling (RegCM) experiments for a CO2 doubling (compared to a control run experiment). We then formed two types of climate change scenarios based on the changes in climate found in the control and doubled CO2 experiments over the conterminous U. S. of RegCM: (1) one using only mean monthly changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation; and (2) another that included these mean changes plus changes in daily (and interannual) variability. The scenarios were then applied to the CERES-Wheat model at four locations (Goodland, Topeka, Des Moines, Spokane) in the United States. Contrasting model responses to the two scenarios were found at three of the four sites. At Goodland, and Des Moines mean climate change increased mean yields and decreased yield variability, but the mean plus variance climate change reduced yields to levels closer to their base (unchanged) condition. At Spokane mean climate change increased yields, which were somewhat further increased with climate variability change. Three key aspects that contribute to crop response are identified: the marginality of the current climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and variance changes, and timing of these changes. Indices for quantifying uncertainty in the impact assessment were developed based on the nature of the climate scenario formed, and the magnitude of difference between model and observed values of relevant climate variables.},

We focus on California, which is vulnerable to hydrologic impacts of climate change. We statistically bias correct and downscale temperature and precipitation projections from 10 GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. These GCM simulations include a control period ( unchanging CO2 and other forcing) and perturbed period (1\%/ year CO2 increase). We force a hydrologic model with the downscaled GCM data to generate streamflow at strategic points. While the different GCMs predict significantly different regional climate responses to increasing atmospheric CO2, hydrological responses are robust across models: decreases in summer low flows and increases in winter flows, and a shift of flow to earlier in the year. Summer flow decreases become consistent across models at lower levels of greenhouse gases than increases in winter flows do.},

	abstract = {Regional risk assessments for the potential effects of climate change rely on plausible small-scale climate change scenario data. To bridge the gap between the coarse scale of general circulation models and the local scale of approximately 11000 sample sites of the Austrian National Forest Inventory (AFI), a seasonally stratified statistical downscaling procedure was applied to a control run and 2 transient experiments of ECHAM4/OPYC3, which are based on the trace gas only or trace gas plus sulphate scenario IPCC IS92a. We fitted multiple linear regression (MLR) models for the micro-scale monthly precipitation and temperature for each AFI point. The meteorological data at the AFI sites were obtained by interpolation of measurements from the dense network of Austrian weather stations for the period 1961-1995. The macro- scale predictors were principal components of monthly NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (850 and 700 hPa geopotential. height, 850 hPa temperature and 700 hPa relative humidity). The results show spatial and temporal heterogeneity for both temperature and precipitation. In case of temperature MLR leads to increases from +1.4 to +4.0degreesC (trace gas only integration) and from +1.1 to +2.9degreesC (trace gas plus sulphate integration) for a period of about 55 yr relative to the 1961-1995 climatology. The regionalized precipitation changes are both negative and positive. Values range from -44 to + 26 \% (trace gas only integration) and from -29 to + 26 \% (trace gas plus sulphate integration). As expected, the explained variability for temperature was higher than for precipitation and depended on the season. From a validation experiment for model calibration we conclude that MLR shows reliable results for temperature. Even in the case of precipitation the method seems to yield plausible results. Both temperature and precipitation were better reproduced for winter than for summer.},

	abstract = {The study investigates a simple statistically based scheme for translating large scale general circulation model (GCM) information to local scale where natural and socio-economic environments are dependent on climatic variables. Two GCM grid cells were chosen, one centred on Montpellier (France), the other on Sevilla (Spain). For each meteorological station over these cells, the relative values of mean monthly temperature compared with the GCM grid cell mean were expressed as percentages, and were called 'relative temperatures' (RT). Using geostatistical procedures, the spatial structure of RT was sought on both GCM grid cells, with the altitude as external drift. The months of January and July were studied during the 1979-1993 period. For each month, the characteristics of the variograms of RT are close for each year of the period. There is also a good inter-annual persistence of spatial patterns of RT when the correlation between altitude and RT is significant. The results will be of great interest for easily estimating local values of mean monthly temperature at any place within each grid cell without further calculation.

	abstract = {Summary Runoff climate change projections for the 21st century were calculated from a suite of 30 General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations for the A1B emission scenario in a 0.5° × 0.5° grid over Central America. The GCM data were downscaled using a version of the Bias Correction and Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) method and then used in the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model. The VIC model showed calibration skill in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, but the results for some of the northern countries (Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize) and for the Caribbean coast of Central America was not satisfactory. Bias correction showed to remove effectively the biases in the GCMs. Results of the projected climate in the 2050–2099 period showed median significant reductions in precipitation (as much as 5–10\%) and runoff (as much as 10–30\%) in northern Central America. Therefore in this sub-region the prevalence of severe drought may increase significantly in the future under this emissions scenario. Northern Central America could warm as much as 3 °C during 2050–2099 and southern Central America could reach increases as much as 4 °C during the same period. The projected dry pattern over Central America is consistent with a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In addition, downscaling of the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data from 1948 to 2012 and posterior run in VIC, for two locations in the northern and southern sub-regions of Central America, suggested that the annual runoff has been decreasing since ca. 1980, which is consistent with the sign of the runoff changes of the GCM projections. However, the Reanalysis 1980–2012 drying trends are generally much stronger than the corresponding GCM trends. Among the possible reasons for that discrepancy are model deficiencies, amplification of the trends due to constructive interference with natural modes of variability in the Reanalysis data, errors in the Reanalysis (modeled) precipitation data, and that the drying signal is more pronounced than predicted by the emissions scenario used. A few studies show that extrapolations of future climate from paleoclimatic indicators project a wetter climate in northern Central America, which is inconsistent with the modeling results presented here. However, these types of extrapolations should be done with caution, as the future climate responds to an extra forcing mechanism (anthropogenic) that was not present prehistorically and therefore the response could also be different than in the past.},

	abstract = {High spatial resolution of precipitation (P) and average air temperature (Tavg) datasets are ideal for determining the spatial patterns associated with large-scale atmospheric and oceanic indexes, and climate change and variability studies, however such datasets are not usually available. Those datasets are particularly important for Central America because they allow the conception of climate variability and climate change studies in a region of high climatic heterogeneity and at the same time aid the decisionmaking process at the local scale (municipalities and districts). Tavg data from stations and complementary gridded datasets at 50 km resolution were used to generate a high-resolution (5 km grid) dataset for Central America from 1970 to 1999. A highresolution P dataset was used along with the new Tavg dataset to study climate variability and a climate change application. Consistently with other studies, it was found that the 1970-1999 trends in P are generally non-significant, with the exception of a few small locations. In the case of Tavg, there were significant warming trends in most of Central America, and cooling trends in Honduras and northern Panama. When the sea surface temperature anomalies between the Tropical Pacific and the Tropical Atlantic have different (same) sign, they are a good indicator of the sign of P (Tavg) annual anomalies. Even with non-significant trends in precipitation, the significant warming trends in Tavg in most of Central America can have severe consequences in the hydrology and water availability of the region, as the warming would bring increases in evapotranspiration, drier soils and higher aridity.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Two dynamically and statistically downscaled precipitation scenarios for Sweden are compared with respect to changes in the mean, The dynamically downscaled scenarios are generated by a 44 km version of the Rossby Centre regional climate model (RCM). The RCM is driven by data from 2 global greenhouse gas simulations sharing a 2.6degreesC global warming, one made by the HadCM2 and the other by the ECHAM4 general circulation model (GCM). The statistical downscaling model driven by the same GCMs is regression-based and incorporates large-scale circulation indices of the 2 geostrophic wind components (u and v), total vorticity (xi) and large-scale humidity at 850 hPa (q850) as predictors. The precipitation climates of the GCMs, RCMs and statistical models from the control runs are compared with respect to their ability to reproduce the observed seasonal cycle. Great improvements in the simulation of the seasonal cycle by all the downscaling models compared to the GCMs significantly increase the credibility of the downscaling models, The precipitation changes produced by the statistical models result from changes in all predictors, but the change in 4 is the greatest contributor in southern Sweden followed by q850 and u, while changes in q850 have greater effects in the northern parts of the country. The temporal and spatial variability of precipitation changes are higher in the statistically downscaled scenarios than in the dynamically downscaled ones. Comparisons of the 4 scenarios show that the spread of the scenarios created by the statistical model is on average larger than that between the RCM scenarios. The relatively large average spread is mainly due to the large differences found in summer. The seasonally averaged difference of the dynamical and statistical scenarios for the ECHAM4-based downscaled scenarios is 12\%, and for the HadCM2 downscaled scenarios 21\%. The differences in annual precipitation change are smaller, on average 4.5\% among the HadCM2-based downscaled scenarios, and 6.9\% among the ECHAM4-based downscaling scenarios.},

Monthly means from 20 observed winters are used to fit a statistical model. that describes the dependence between both parameters. Further observations from this century are used to validate this model, which is able to estimate sea level anomalies from the air-pressure held to a good level of approximation. Sea level anomalies with periods from months to decades are reproduced well. As main Forcing For the sea level anomalies, wind-stress with a strong zonal component is identified. For the past 89 years, we found that a slight decrease of mean sea level was induced by air-pressure.

In effect, the nodes represent a non-linear distribution of overlapping, non-discreet, circulation types. The circulation patterns are readily visualized in a 2- dimensional array (the SOM) that places similar types adjacent to one another and very different types far apart in the SOM space. The SOM is used to describe synoptic circulation changes over time, and to relate the circulation to January station precipitation data (for State College, Pennsylvania) in the center of the domain. The paper focuses on the methodology; however, the analysis suggests that circulation systems that promote precipitation have decreased over the last 40 yr- although January precipitation at State College has actually increased. Further analysis with the SOM indicates that this is due to a change in precipitation characteristics of the synoptic-scale circulation features, rather than to their frequency of occurrence.},

Drought indices, most commonly the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), have been used with limited success as operational drought monitoring tools and triggers for policy responses. Recently, a new index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), was developed to improve drought detection and monitoring capabilities. The SPI has several characteristics that are an improvement over previous indices, including its simplicity and temporal flexibility, that allow its application for water resources on all timescales. In this article, the 1996 drought in the southern plains and southwestern United States is examined using the SPI. A series of maps are used to illustrate how the SPI would have assisted in being able to detect the onset of the drought and monitor its progression. A case study investigating the drought in greater detail for Texas is also given. The SPI demonstrated that it is a tool that should be used operationally as part of a state, regional, or national drought watch system in the United States. During the 1996 drought, the SPI detected the onset of the drought at least 1 month in advance of the PDSI. This timeliness will be invaluable for improving mitigation and response actions of state and federal government to drought-affected regions in the future.},

A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was developed for each basin using station data and output from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2. The SDS model was then used to simulate local climate variables using HadCM2 output for current and future conditions. Surface climate variables from each scenario were used in a precipitation-runoff model. Results from this study show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using statistically downscaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2 output for current or future climate assessments are questionable because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface variables needed for runoff in these regions. Given the uncertainties in the GCMs ability to simulate current conditions based on either the delta change or downscaling approaches, future climate assessments based on either of these approaches must be treated with caution.},

This paper presents a step wise, multiple objective, automated procedure for hydrologic model calibration.

The procedure uses the Shuffled Complex Evolution global search algorithm to calibrate the U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modeling System in the Yampa River basin of Colorado. This process assures that intermediate states of the model (SR and PET on a monthly mean basis), as well as the water balance and components of the daily hydrograph are simulated consistently with measured values.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of future climate change depends substantially on the greenhouse gas emission pathways we choose. Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50-75\%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30-70\%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75-90\%; and snowpack declines 73-90\%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades.},

	issn = {1093-474X},
	abstract = {A monthly water-balance (WB) model was tested in 44 river basins from diverse physiographic and climatic regions across the conterminous United States (U.S.). The WB model includes the concepts of climatic water supply and climatic water demand, seasonality in climatic water supply and demand, and soil-moisture storage. Exhaustive search techniques were employed to determine the optimal set of precipitation and temperature stations, and the optimal set of WB model parameters to use for each basin. It was found that the WB model worked best for basins with: (1) a mean elevation less than 450 meters or greater than 2000 meters, and/or (2) monthly runoff that is greater than 5 millimeters (mm) more than 80 percent of the time. In a separate analysis, a multiple linear regression (MLR) was computed using the adjusted R-square values obtained by comparing measured and estimated monthly runoff of the original 44 river basins as the dependent variable, and combinations of various independent variables [streamflow gauge latitude, longitude, and elevation; basin area, the long-term mean and standard deviation of annual precipitation; temperature and runoff, and low-flow statistics (i.e., the percentage of months with monthly runoff that is less than 5 mm)]. Results from the MLR study showed that the reliability of a WB model for application in a specific region can be estimated from mean basin elevation and the percentage of months with gauged runoff less than 5 mm. The MLR equations were subsequently used to estimate adjusted R-square values for 1,646 gauging stations across the conterminous U.S. Results of this study indicate that WB models can be used reliably to estimate monthly runoff in the eastern U.S., mountainous areas of the western U.S., and the Pacific Northwest, Applications of monthly WB models in the central U.S. can lead to uncertain estimates of runoff.},

Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on agriculture and ecosystem services for their livelihoods. There is an urgent need to develop national and local adaptation responses to reduce these impacts, yet evidence from historical climate change is fragmentary. Modeling efforts help bridge this gap. Here, we review the past decade of research on agricultural and ecological climate change impact models for Central America. The results of this review provide insights into the expected impacts of climate change and suggest policy actions that can help minimize these impacts. Modeling indicates future climate-driven changes, often declines, in suitability for Central American crops. Declines in suitability for coffee, a central crop in the regional economy, are noteworthy. Ecosystem models suggest that climate-driven changes are likely at low- and high-elevation montane forest transitions. Modeling of vulnerability suggests that smallholders in many parts of the region have one or more vulnerability factors that put them at risk. Initial adaptation policies can be guided by these existing modeling results. At the same time, improved modeling is being developed that will allow policy action specifically targeted to vulnerable groups, crops, and locations. We suggest that more robust modeling of ecological responses to climate change, improved representation of the region in climate models, and simulation of climate influences on crop yields and diseases (especially coffee leaf rust) are key priorities for future research.},

	abstract = {A mathematical in-lake water temperature model (WATEMP-Lake) was developed to investigate future responses of lake stratification and temperature profiles to future climate change due to rising concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs). The model was used to simulate daily water temperature profiles and stratification characteristics in summer (June, July, and August -JJA) for Suwa Lake in Japan as a case study. For future assessments, the model uses surface climate variables obtained from a downscaling method that was applied to the UK Hadley Centre's coupled ocean/atmosphere model forced by combined CO2 and sulphate aerosol changes (HadCM2SUL). The downscaling method employed mean sea level surface pressure to derive three airflow indices identified as: the total shear vorticity (Z) -a measure of cyclonicity -, the strength of the resultant flow (F), and the overall flow direction (D). Statistical relationships between these indices and seven daily meteorological time series were formulated to represent climate variable series at sites around Suwa Lake. These relationships were used to downscale the observed climatology of 1979-1995 and that of 2080-2099 using HadCM2SUL outputs. (C) 1998 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	title = {Physical aspects of the weather generator},
	volume = {213},
	abstract = {One task in BAHC is to develop a physical understanding of the weather generator (WG). The core of the WG concept is scale interaction, represented by upscaling and downscaling, between the gridscale atmospheric fields and the subgrid-scale hydrological and ecosystem patterns. This paper considers scale interaction in terms of the convective ( = latent plus sensible heat) and rain fluxes. Earth's surface and atmosphere are coupled through these fluxes. However, horizontal scale interaction in the free atmosphere is physically different from that at the surface. Upscaling atmospheric fluxes generates new sub-gridscale fluxes at the lower grid resolution, caused by the gridscale fluxes resolved at the higher grid resolution. Downscaling has to recover these secondary circulations, usually through mesoscale submodels. The same gridscale eddy effect is zero for surface fluxes because there is no cross- surface mass flux of air. The atmospheric fluxes on the various scales are quantified here with an atmospheric diagnostic model (DIAMOD) coupled to a surface flux model (SURFMOD). Two convectively active periods over Europe tone disturbed, one undisturbed) are considered. Upscaling from 100 to 1000 km horizontal resolution generates additional grid-scale eddy fluxes. However, these amount, in both cases, to just 10\% of the diagnosed fluxes that are sub-gridscale at 100 km; this suggests that the additional gridscale eddy effect may be negligible in convective situations. We further apply a simple downscaling recipe for disturbed periods (scale the rain flux profiles with the observed surface rain) and for undisturbed periods (scale the convective flux profiles with the observed surface latent plus sensible heat flux). At the Earth's surface, we study the upscaling-downscaling mechanism, not with diagnosed, but with modeled latent and sensible heat fluxes. With a simplified version of SURFMOD, plus the probability density function of soil moisture, we reproduce the fatal impact of taking mean soil moisture for calculating mean evaporation: evaporation can be underestimated by 25\% in dry situations and overestimated by 10\% in moist situations. We demonstrate how to completely remove this bias. The technique presented here can be generalized to a wide class of deterministic and statistical models and offers a rational framework for the aggregation problem and the WG problem in general.

	abstract = {Small-scale (less than;15 km) precipitation variability significantly affects the hydrologic response of a basin and the accurate estimation of water and energy fluxes through coupled land-atmosphere modeling schemes. It also affects the radiative transfer through precipitating clouds and thus rainfall estimation from microwave sensors. Because both land- atmosphere and cloud-radiation interactions are nonlinear and occur over a broad range of scales (from a few centimeters to several kilometers), it is important that, over these scales, cloud-resolving numerical models realistically reproduce the observed precipitation variability. This issue is examined herein by using a suite of multiscale statistical methods to compare the scale dependence of precipitation variability of a numerically simulated convective storm with that observed by radar. In particular, Fourier spectrum, structure function, and moment-scale analyses are used to show that, although the variability of modeled precipitation agrees with that observed for scales larger than approximately 5 times the model resolution, the model shows a falloff in variability at smaller scales. Thus, depending upon the smallest scale at which variability is considered to be important for a specific application, one has to resort either to very high resolution model runs (resolutions 5 times higher than the scale of interest) or to stochastic methods that can introduce the missing small-scale variability. The latter involve upscaling the model output to a scale approximately 5 times the model resolution and then stochastically downscaling it to smaller scales. The results of multiscale analyses, such as those presented herein, are key to the implementation of such stochastic downscaling methodologies.},

	abstract = {A new method for frequency analysis of hydrologic time series was developed to facilitate the estimation and reconstruction of individual or groups of frequencies from hydrologic time-series and facilitate the comparison of these isolated time-series components across data types, between different hydrologic settings within a watershed, between watersheds, and across frequencies. While climate-related variations in inflow to and outflow from aquifers have often been neglected, the development and management of ground-water and surface-water resources has required the inclusion of the assessment of the effects of climatic variability on the supply and demand and sustainability of use. The regional assessment of climatic variability of surface-water and ground-water flow throughout the southwestern United States required this new systematic method of hydrologic time-series analysis.
To demonstrate the application of this new method, six hydrologic time-series from the Mojave River Basin, California were analyzed. The results indicate that climatic variability exists in all the data types and are partially coincident with known climate cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The time-series also indicate lagged correlations between tree-ring indices, streamflow, stream base flow, and ground-water levels. These correlations and reconstructed time-series can be used to better understand the relation of hydrologic response to climatic forcings and to facilitate the simulation of streamflow and ground-water recharge for a more realistic approach to water-resource management.

	abstract = {As part of the National Assessment of Climate Change, the implications of future climate predictions derived from four global climate models (GCMs) were used to evaluate possible future changes to Pacific Northwest climate, the surface water response of the Columbia River basin, and the ability of the Columbia River reservoir system to meet regional water resources objectives. Two representative GCM simulations from the Hadley Centre (HC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) were selected from a group of GCM simulations made available via the National Assessment for climate change. Although the two GCM simulations showed somewhat different seasonal patterns for temperature change, in general the simulations show reasonably consistent basin average increases in temperature of about 1.8-2.1 degree C for 2025, and about 2.3-2.9 degree C for 2045. The HC simulations predict an annual average temperature increase of about 4.5 degree C for 2095. Changes in basin averaged winter precipitation range from -1 percent to +20 percent for the HC and MPI scenarios, and summer precipitation is also variously affected. These changes in climate result in significant increases in winter runoff volumes due to increased winter precipitation and warmer winter temperatures, with resulting reductions in snowpack. Average March 1 basin average snow water equivalents are 75 to 85 percent of the base case for 2025, and 55 to 65 percent of the base case by 2045. By 2045 the reduced snowpack and earlier snow melt, coupled with higher evapotranspiration in early summer, would lead to earlier spring peak flows and reduced runoff volumes from April-September ranging from about 75 percent to 90 percent of the base case. Annual runoff volumes range from 85 percent to 110 percent of the base case in the simulations for 2045. These changes in streamflow create increased competition for water during the spring, summer, and early fall between non-firm energy production, irrigation, instream flow, and recreation. Flood control effectiveness is moderately reduced for most of the scenarios examined, and desirable navigation conditions on the Snake are generally enhanced or unchanged.

	abstract = {A simple method has been devised to incorporate the Fl Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) climate signals into the well-known extended streamflow prediction forecasting approach. Forecasts of ENSO are currently available up to a year or more in advance, which facilitates forecasting of the streamflow response to this climate signal at interannual forecast lead times. The biomodal phase of the PDO can be identified in real time using a combination of assumed persistence of the existing phase and the tracking of extreme events to identify transitions. The technique makes use of a gridded meteorological data set to drive a macroscale hydrology model at 1 degrees spatial resolution over the Columbia River Basin above The Dalles. A streamflow forecast ensemble is created by resampling from the historical meteorological data according to six predefined PDO/ENSO categories. Given a forecast of the ENSO climate signal for the coming water year and the existing phase of the PDO, these meteorological ensembles are then used to drive the hydrology model based on the initial soil and snow conditions as of the forecast date. To evaluate the technique, a retrospective forecast of the historic record was prepared (1989-1998), using October-September as the forecast period, as well as an ensemble forecast for water years 1999 and 2000 that were prepared on June 1, 1998 and May 10, 1999, respectively. The results demonstrate the increase in lead time and forecast specificity over climatology that can be achieved by using PDO and ENSO climate information to condition the forecast ensembles.},

	abstract = {The Columbia Basin Climate Change Scenarios Project (CBCCSP) was conceived as a comprehensive hydrologic database to support climate change planning, impacts assessment, and adaptation in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) by a diverse user community with varying technical capacity over a wide range of spatial scales. The study has constructed a state-of-the-art, end-to-end data processing sequence from ?raw? climate model output to a suite of hydrologic modelling products that are served to the user community from a web-accessible database. A calibrated 1/16 degree latitude-longitude resolution implementation of the VIC hydrologic model over the Columbia River basin was used to produce historical simulations and 77 future hydrologic projections associated with three different statistical downscaling methods and three future time periods (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s). Key products from the study include summary data for about 300 river locations in the PNW and monthly Geographic Information System products for 21 hydrologic variables over the entire study domain. Results from the study show profound changes in spring snowpack and fundamental shifts from snow and mixed-rain-and-snow to rain-dominant behaviour across most of the domain. Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing. The CBCCSP database has been a valuable public resource that has dramatically reduced costs in a number of high-visibility studies in the PNW and western United States focused on technical coordination and planning. RÉSUMÉ?[Traduit par la rédaction] Le projet de scénarios de changement climatique du bassin du Columbia (CBCCSP) a été conçu comme une base de données hydrologiques complète pour appuyer les activités de planification, d?évaluation des répercussions et d'adaptation dans la région pacifique nord?ouest menées par une communauté d'utilisateurs diversifiée disposant de capacités techniques variées dans une large gamme d?échelles spatiales. L?étude a produit une séquence de traitements de données de bout en bout, à la fine pointe, partant d'une sortie « brute » de modèle climatique pour aboutir à une série de produits de modélisation hydrologique, qui sont offerts à la communauté d'utilisateurs via une base de données Web. Nous avons implémenté une résolution latitude?longitude calibrée à 1/16 de degré dans le modèle à capacité d'infiltration variable (VIC) et avons appliqué dans le modèle bassin du fleuve Columbia pour produire des simulations historiques et 77 projections hydrologiques futures correspondant à trois méthodes de réduction d?échelle statistique et trois périodes futures (les décennies 2020, 2040 et 2080). Les principaux produits de l?étude comprennent des données sommaires pour environ 300 sites fluviaux dans la région pacifique nord?ouest et des produits mensuels de Système d'information géographique pour 21 variables hydrologiques couvrant tout le domaine à l?étude. Les résultats de l?étude montrent de profonds changements dans l'accumulation de neige au printemps et des déplacements radicaux de « neige ou pluie et neige mêlées » vers « princ palement pluie » dans presque tout le domaine. Des déplacements correspondants des caractéristiques d?écoulement fluvial du printemps et de l?été vers l'hiver sont également évidents dans les bassins où l'accumulation de neige est importante en hiver (sous le climat actuel). L?évapotranspiration potentielle augmente dans la majeure partie de la région du Pacifique et du Nord?Ouest en été à cause des températures plus élevées; cependant, l?évaporation réelle est réduite dans presque tous les secteurs du domaine parce que l?évapotranspiration est principalement limitée par l'eau en été et les précipitations estivales diminuent dans les simulations. Des accroissements généralisés simulés de la réhumidification du sol en automne et en hiver dans les secteurs où l'accumulation de neige en hiver est importante (sous le climat actuel) appuient les hypothèses de risque accru de glissement de terrain et de transport de sédiments durant l'hiver dans le futur. Les simulations d?écoulements de crue et d?étiage augmentent en intensité pour la plupart des sites fluviaux compris dans cette étude. Les plus fortes augmentations dans les crues sont dans les bassins de pluie et neige mêlées dont les températures actuelles au milieu de l'hiver sont à quelques degrés du point de congélation. La base de données du CBCCSP s'est avérée une ressource publique précieuse qui a permis de réduire énormément les coûts liés à un certain nombre d?études de haute visibilité dans la région pacifique nord?ouest et dans l'ouest des États?Unis axées sur la coordination technique et la planification.},

	abstract = {Differences in simulations of climate feedbacks are sources of significant divergence in climate models' temperature response to anthropogenic forcing. Snow albedo feedback is particularly critical for climate change prediction in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses. Here we show its strength in current models exhibits a factor-of-three spread. These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle. Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values. These mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, suggesting many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context. Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change. Though this comparison to observations may put the models in an unduly harsh light because of uncertainties in the observed estimate that are difficult to quantify, our results map out a clear strategy for targeted observation of the seasonal cycle to reduce divergence in simulations of climate sensitivity.},

These changes have affected streamflow, including the probability of high flow. In the eastern half of the United States a significant relationship is found between the frequency of heavy precipitation and high streamflow events both annually and during the months of maximum streamflow. Two factors contributed to finding such a relation: 1) the relatively small contribution of snowmelt to heavy runoff in the eastern United States (compared to the west), and 2) the presence of a sufficiently dense network of streamflow and precipitation gauges available for analysis. An increase of spring heavy precipitation events over the eastern United States indicates with high probability that during the twentieth century an increase of high streamflow conditions has also occurred. In the West, a statistically significant reduction of snow cover extent has complicated the relation between heavy precipitation and streamflow. Increases in peak stream flow have not been observed here, despite increases in heavy precipitation events, and less extensive snow cover is the likely cause.},

	volume = {42},
	issn = {0165-0009},
	abstract = {A simple statistical model of daily precipitation based on the gamma distribution is applied to summer (JJA in Northern Hemisphere, DJF in Southern Hemisphere) data from eight countries: Canada, the United States, Mexico, the former Soviet Union, China, Australia, Norway, and Poland. These constitute more than 40\% of the global land mass, and more than 80\% of the extratropical land area. It is shown that the shape parameter of this distribution remains relatively stable, while the scale parameter is most variable spatially and temporally. This implies that the changes in mean monthly precipitation totals tend to have the most influence on the heavy precipitation rates in these countries. Observations show that in each country under consideration (except China), mean summer precipitation has increased by at least 5\% in the past century. In the USA, Norway, and Australia the frequency of summer precipitation events has also increased, but there is little evidence of such increases in any of the countries considered during the past fiffty years. A scenario is considered, whereby mean summer precipitation increases by 5\% with no change in the number of days with precipitation or the shape parameter. When applied in the statistical model, the probability of daily precipitation exceeding 25.4 mm (1 inch) in northern countries (Canada, Norway, Russia, and Poland) or 50.8 mm (2 inches) in mid-latitude countries (the USA, Mexico, China, and Australia) increases by about 20\% (nearly four times the increase in mean). The contribution of heavy rains (above these thresholds) to the total 5\% increase of precipitation is disproportionally high (up to 50\%), while heavy rain usually constitutes a significantly smaller fraction of the precipitation events and totals in extratropical regions (but up to 40\% in the tropics, e.g., in southern Mexico). Scenarios with moderate changes in the number of days with precipitation coupled with changes in the scale parameter were also investigated and found to produce smaller increases in heavy rainfall but still support the above conclusions. These scenarios give changes in heavy rainfall which are comparable to those observed and are consistent with the greenhouse-gas-induced increases in heavy precipitation simulated by some climate models for the next century. In regions with adequate data coverage such as the eastern two-thirds of contiguous United States, Norway, eastern Australia, and the European part of the former USSR, the statistical model helps to explain the disproportionate high changes in heavy precipitation which have been observed.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from a new version of the Hadley Centre coupled model (HadCM3) that does not require flux adjustments to prevent large climate drifts in the simulation. The model has both an improved atmosphere and ocean component. In particular, the ocean has a 1.25 degrees x 1.25 degrees degree horizontal resolution and leads to a considerably improved simulation of ocean heat transports compared to earlier versions with a coarser resolution ocean component. The model does not have any spin up procedure prior to coupling and the simulation has been run for over 400 years starting from observed initial conditions. The sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice simulation are shown to be stable and realistic. The trend in global mean SST is less than 0.009 degrees C per century. In part, the improved simulation is a consequence of a greater compatibility of the atmosphere and ocean model heat budgets. The atmospheric model surface heat and momentum budget are evaluated by comparing with climatological ship-based estimates. Similarly the ocean model simulation of poleward heat transports is compared with direct ship-based observations for a number of sections across the globe. Despite the limitations of the observed datasets, it is shown that the coupled model is able to reproduce many aspects of the observed heat budget.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Investigation of the links between atmospheric circulation patterns and rainfall is important for the understanding of climatic variability and for the development of empirical circulation-based downscaling methods. Here, spatial and temporal variations in circulation-rainfall relationships over the Iberian Peninsula during the period 1958-97 are explored using an automated circulation classification scheme and daily rainfall totals for 18 stations. Links between the circulation classification scheme and the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are also considered, as are the direct links between rainfall and the NAO. Trends in rainfall and circulation-type frequency are explored. A general tendency towards decreasing mean seasonal rainfall over the peninsula, with the exception of the southeastern Mediterranean coast, hides larger changes in wet day amount and rainfall probability. There is a tendency towards more, less-intensive rain days across much of Iberia, with a tendency towards more, more-intensive rain days along the southeastern Mediterranean coast, both of which are reflected in changes in rainfall amount quantiles. A preliminary analysis indicates that these changes may have occurred systematically across all circulation types. Comparison of the trends in rainfall and in circulation-type frequency suggests possible links. These links are supported by linear regression analyses using circulation-type frequencies as predictor variables and rainfall totals for winter months as the predictands. The selected predictor variables reflect the main circulation features influencing winter rainfall across the peninsula, i.e. the strong influence of Atlantic westerly and southwesterly airmasses over much of the peninsula, of northerly and northwesterly surface flow over northern/northwestern Spain and northern Portugal and the stronger effect of Mediterranean rather than Atlantic influences in southeastern Spain. The observed rainfall changes cannot, however, be explained by changes in circulation alone. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

The estimation of the regional changes caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols therefore is problematic. Here a statistical downscaling scheme is used to study the relationship between large-scale sea lever pressure and regional precipitation in southwestern Europe, both in observed data and in outputs from a general circulation model (GCM) forced with increasing levers of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. The results indicate that the GCM does reproduce the main aspects of the large- to local-scale coupled variability. Furthermore, these large- to local-scale relationships remain stable in the scenario simulations. The GCM runs predict increases of advection of oceanic air masses to the Iberian Peninsula that will produce a slight decrease of precipitation amounts in the north coast and the opposite effect in the rest of the territory, with values that could reach 10 mm decade(-1) in the south. In the homogenized historical records, the obtained pattern of change is very similar. These results support estimations of future regional trends simulated by the GCM under future emission scenarios.},

	abstract = {Freshwater resources are fundamental for maintaining human health, agricultural production, economic activity as well as critical ecosystem functions. As populations and economies grow, new constraints on water resources are appearing, raising questions about limits to water availability. Such resource questions are not new. The specter of “peak oil”—a peaking and then decline in oil production—has long been predicted and debated. We present here a detailed assessment and definition of three concepts of “peak water”: peak renewable water, peak nonrenewable water, and peak ecological water. These concepts can help hydrologists, water managers, policy makers, and the public understand and manage different water systems more effectively and sustainably. Peak renewable water applies where flow constraints limit total water availability over time. Peak nonrenewable water is observable in groundwater systems where production rates substantially exceed natural recharge rates and where overpumping or contamination leads to a peak of production followed by a decline, similar to more traditional peak-oil curves. Peak “ecological” water is defined as the point beyond which the total costs of ecological disruptions and damages exceed the total value provided by human use of that water. Despite uncertainties in quantifying many of these costs and benefits in consistent ways, more and more watersheds appear to have already passed the point of peak water. Applying these concepts can help shift the way freshwater resources are managed toward more productive, equitable, efficient, and sustainable use.},

	abstract = {Within the next few decades, changes in global temperature and precipitation patterns caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other trace gases are likely to appear. At present, the regional hydrologic impacts of such climatic changes cannot be evaluated with any certainty. Using modified water balance methods, a model of a critical hydrologic basin, the Sacramento Basin in California, is developed and tested for the purpose of investigating the effects on water availability of changes in climate. This basin was chosen because of the importance of its water supplies to agricultural and industrial productivity and because of the quality and quantity of the hydrologic data available. The water balance model is capable of reproducing both the magnitude and the timing of monthly and seasonal runoff, as well as changes in soil moisture conditions. The results suggest that the application of such models may provide considerably more information on regional hydrologic effects of climatic changes than is currently available. Such information is likely to have important ramifications for long-range water resource planning, for agricultural water resource development and conservation, and for industrial water use over the next several decades.

	volume = {113},
	abstract = {Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called â€œmean modelâ€ consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {The increasing demand by the scientific community, policy makers, and the public for realistic projections of possible regional impacts of future climate changes has rendered the issue of regional climate simulation critically important. The problem of projecting regional climate changes can be identified as that of representing effects of atmospheric forcings on two different spatial scales: large-scale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the general circulation and determine the sequence of weather events which characterize the climate regime of a given region (for example, greenhouse gas abundance), and mesoscale forcings, i.e., forcings which modify the local circulations, thereby regulating the regional distribution of climatic variables (for example, complex mountainous systems). General circulation models (GCMs) are the main tools available today for climate simulation. However, they are run and will likely be run for the next several years at resolutions which are too coarse to adequately describe mesoscale forcings and yield accurate regional climate detail. This paper presents a review of these approaches. They can be divided in three broad categories: (1) Purely empirical approaches, in which the forcings are not explicitly accounted for, but regional climate scenarios are constructed by using instrumental data records or paleoclimatic analogues; (2) semiempirical approaches, in which GCMs are used to describe the atmospheric response to large-scale forcings of relevance to climate changes, and empirical techniques account for the effect of mesoscale forcings; and (3) modeling approaches, in which mesoscale forcings are described by increasing the model resolution only over areas of interest. Since they are computationally inexpensive, empirical and semiempirical techniques have been so far more widely used. Their application to regional climate change projection is, however, limited by their own empiricism and by the availability of data sets of adequate quality. More recently, a nested GCM-limited area model methodology for regional climate simulation has been developed, with encouraging preliminary results. As it is physically, rather than empirically, based, the nested modeling framework has a wide range of applications.},

For these cases, a performance-based selection of models in producing climate change scenarios can affect the resulting change estimate, and it is noted that a minimum of four to five models is needed to obtain robust precipitation change estimates. In a number of cases, models with largely different precipitation biases can still produce changes of consistent sign. Overall, it is assessed that in the present generation of models the regional bias does not appear to be a dominant factor in determining the simulated regional change in the majority of cases.},

	abstract = {[1] This paper examines the scale dependence of surface climate interannual variability over six regions of the world using a gridded observed dataset of precipitation and surface air temperature for the period 1961-1990. The scales analysed cover the range of 0.5 to 3.5 degrees in longitude/latitude. The interannual variability of precipitation exhibits a strong sensitivity to spatial scale, especially at the finer scales analysed, while the interannual variability of temperature shows a weak sensitivity to spatial scale. The scale sensitivity of interannual variability is maximum in warm climate regimes, such as over tropical and subtropical regions and in the summer season. These results have important implications for climate predictability (e.g., at seasonal and longer temporal scales) and for the identification of climatic trends and changes. They indicate that the prediction and detection of precipitation changes becomes a substantially more difficult task as the scale of interest is increasingly refined. Conversely, for temperature, since the variability is characterized by broader spatial scales, scale refinement is a less important factor.},

	abstract = {By matching large-scale patterns in climate fields with patterns in observed station precipitation, this work explores seasonal predictability of precipitation in the contiguous United States for all seasons. Although it is shown that total seasonal precipitation and frequencies of less-than-extreme daily precipitation events can be predicted with much higher skill, the focus of this study is on frequencies of daily precipitation above the seasonal 90th percentile (P90), a variable whose skillful prediction is more challenging. Frequency of heavy daily precipitation is shown to respond to ENSO as well as to non-ENSO interannual and interdecadal variability in the North Pacific.
Specification skill achieved by a statistical model based on contemporaneous SST forcing with and without an explicit dynamical atmosphere is compared and contrasted. Statistical models relating the SST forcing patterns directly to observed station precipitation are shown to perform consistently better in all seasons than hybrid (dynamical-statistical) models where the SST forcing is first translated to atmospheric circulation via three separate general circulation models and the dynamically computed circulation anomalies are statistically related to observed precipitation. Skill is summarized for all seasons, but in detail for January-February-March, when it is shown that predictable patterns are spatially robust regardless of the approach used. Predictably, much of the skill is due to ENSO. While the U. S. average skill is modest, regional skill levels can be quite high. It is also found that non-ENSO-related skill is significant, especially for the extreme Southwest and that this is due mostly to non-ENSO interannual and decadal variability in the North Pacific SST forcing.
Although useful specification skill is achieved by both approaches, hybrid predictability is not pursued further in this effort. Rather, prognostic analysis is carried out with the purely statistical approach to analyze P90 predictability based on antecedent SST forcing. Skill at various lead times is investigated and it is shown that significant regional skill can be achieved at lead times of several months even in the absence of strong ENSO forcing.},

For El Nino winters, the hybrid approach emerges as the best performer, while La Nina forecasting skill is poor. The full-statistical forecasting method features reasonable forecasting skill for both La Nina and El Nino winters. The performance of the full-dynamical approach could not be evaluated as rigorously as that of the other two forecasting schemes. Although the full-dynamical forecasting approach is expected to outperform simpler forecasting schemes in the long run, evidence is presented to conclude that, at present, the full-dynamical forecasting approach is the least viable of the three, at least in California.

	abstract = {A monthly snowpack and soil-moisture-accounting model is formulated for application to each of the climate divisions of the conterminous United States for use in climate impacts assessment studies. Statistical downscaling and bias adjustment components complement the model for the assimilation of large- scale global climate model precipitation and temperature. The model produces monthly streamflow that is broadly consistent with observed streamflow from several drainage basins in the United States for the period 1931-1998. Simulated historical soil moisture fields reproduce several features of the available observed soil moisture in the Midwest. The simulations produce large-scale coherent seasonal patterns of soil moisture field moments over the conterminous United States, with high soil moisture means over divisions in the Ohio Valley, the northeastern United States, and the Pacific Northwest, and with pronounced low means in most of the western U.S. climate divisions. Characteristically low field standard deviations are produced for the Ohio Valley and northeastern United States, the Pacific Northwest in winter, and the southwestern United States in summer. Differences in extreme standardized anomalies of soil moisture over the historical record possess high values (2.5-3) in the central United States, where the available water capacity of the soils is high. Application of the methodology for future periods using output from the Canadian coupled global climate model (CGCM1) shows that for at least the first few decades of the 21st century, somewhat drier-than-p resent soil conditions are projected, with highest drying trends found in the southeastern United States. The soil moisture deficits in most areas are of the same order of magnitude as the soil moisture field standard deviations arising from historical natural variability.

	abstract = {An improved statistical-dynamical downscaling method for the regionalization of large-scale climate analyses or simulations is introduced. The method is based on the disaggregation of a multi-year time-series of large-scale meteorological data into multi-day episodes of quasistationary circulation. The episodes are subsequently grouped into a defined number of classes. A regional model is used to simulate the evolution of weather during the most typical episode of each class. These simulations consider the effects of the regional topography. Finally, the regional model results are statistically weighted with the climatological frequencies of the respective circulation classes in order to provide regional climate patterns. The statistical-dynamical downscaling procedure is applied to large-scale analyses for a 12-year climate period 1981-1992. The performance of the new method is demonstrated for winter precipitation in the Alpine region. With the help of daily precipitation analyses it was possible to validate the results and to assess the different sources of errors. It appeared that the main error originates from the regional model, whereas the error of the procedure itself was relatively unimportant. This new statistical-dynamical downscaling method turned out to be an efficient alternative to the commonly used method of nesting a regional model continuously within a general circulation model (dynamical downscaling).},

	abstract = {AbstractClimate change–driven shifts in streamflow timing have been documented for western North America and are expected to continue with increased warming. These changes will likely have the greatest implications on already short and overcommitted water supplies in the region. This study investigated changes in western North American streamflow timing over the 1948–2008 period, including the very recent warm decade not previously considered, through (i) trends in streamflow timing measures, (ii) two second-order linear models applied simultaneously over the region to test for the acceleration of these changes, and (iii) changes in runoff regimes. Basins were categorized by the percentage of snowmelt-derived runoff to enable the comparison of groups of streams with similar runoff characteristics and to quantify shifts in snowmelt-dominated regimes. Results indicate that streamflow has continued to shift to earlier in the water year, most notably for those basins with the largest snowmelt runoff component. However, an acceleration of these streamflow timing changes for the recent warm decades is not clearly indicated. Most coastal rain-dominated and some interior basins have experienced later timing. The timing changes are connected to area-wide warmer temperatures, especially in March and January, and to precipitation shifts that bear subregional signatures. Notably, a set of the most vulnerable basins has experienced runoff regime changes, such that basins that were snowmelt dominated at the beginning of the observational period shifted to mostly rain dominated in later years. These most vulnerable regions for regime shifts are in the California Sierra Nevada, eastern Washington, Idaho, and northeastern New Mexico. Snowmelt regime changes may indicate that the time available for adaptation of water supply systems to climatic changes in vulnerable regions are shorter than previously recognized.},

To help explain these differences, the authors devised a monthly water balance model that successfully reproduces the annual and seasonal water balances of the different PILPS schemes. Analysis of this model leads to the identification of two quantities that characterize an LSM\&\#8217;s formulation of soil water balance dynamics: 1) the efficiency of the soil\&\#8217;s evaporation sink integrated over the active soil moisture range, and 2) the fraction of this range over which runoff is generated. Regardless of the LSM\&\#8217;s complexity, the combination of these two derived parameters with rates of interception loss, potential evaporation, and precipitation provides a reasonable estimate for the LSM\&\#8217;s simulated annual water balance. The two derived parameters shed light on how evaporation and runoff formulations interact in an LSM, and the analysis as a whole underscores the need for compatibility in these formulations.},

Here a review of projections of global temperature change over the twenty-first century is provided for the six illustrative emission scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) that assume no policy intervention, based on the latest generation of coupled general circulation models, climate models of intermediate complexity, and simple models, and uncertainty ranges and probabilistic projections from various published methods and models are assessed. Despite substantial improvements in climate models, projections for given scenarios on average have not changed much in recent years. Recent progress has, however, increased the confidence in uncertainty estimates and now allows a better separation of the uncertainties introduced by scenarios, physical feedbacks, carbon cycle, and structural uncertainty. Projection uncertainties are now constrained by observations and therefore consistent with past observed trends and patterns. Future trends in global temperature resulting from anthropogenic forcing over the next few decades are found to be comparably well constrained. Uncertainties for projections on the century time scale, when accounting for structural and feedback uncertainties, are larger than captured in single models or methods. This is due to differences in the models, the sources of uncertainty taken into account, the type of observational constraints used, and the statistical assumptions made. It is shown that as an approximation, the relative uncertainty range for projected warming in 2100 is the same for all scenarios. Inclusion of uncertainties in carbon cycle-climate feedbacks extends the upper bound of the uncertainty range by more than the lower bound.},

	abstract = {California's primary hydrologic system, the San Francisco Estuary and its upstream watershed, is vulnerable to the regional hydrologic consequences of projected global climate change. Previous work has shown that a projected warming would result in a reduction of snowpack storage leading to higher winter and lower spring-summer streamflows and increased spring-summer salinities in the estuary. The present work shows that these hydrologic changes exhibit a strong dependence on elevation, with the greatest loss of snowpack volume in the 1300 - 2700 m elevation range. Exploiting hydrologic and estuarine modeling capabilities to trace water as it moves through the system reveals that the shift of water in mid-elevations of the Sacramento river basin from snowmelt to rainfall runoff is the dominant cause of projected changes in estuarine inflows and salinity. Additionally, although spring-summer losses of estuarine inflows are balanced by winter gains, the losses have a stronger influence on salinity since longer spring-summer residence times allow the inflow changes to accumulate in the estuary. The changes in inflows sourced in the Sacramento River basin in approximately the 1300 - 2200 m elevation range thereby lead to a net increase in estuarine salinity under the projected warming. Such changes would impact ecosystems throughout the watershed and threaten to contaminate much of California's freshwater supply.},

	abstract = {We compared regional biases and transient doubled CO2 sensitivities of nine coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) from six international climate modeling groups. We evaluated biases and responses in winter and summer surface air temperatures and precipitation for seven subcontinental regions, including those in the 1990 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Scientific Assessment. Regional biases were large and exceeded the variance among four climatological datasets, indicating that model biases were not primarily due to uncertainty in observations. Model responses to altered greenhouse forcing were substantial (average temperature change = 2.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C, range of precipitation change = - 35 to + 120\% of control). While coupled models include more climate system feedbacks than earlier GCMs implemented with mixed-layer ocean models, inclusion of a dynamic ocean alone did not improve simulation of long-term mean climatology nor increase convergence among model responses to altered greenhouse gas forcing. On the other hand, features of some of the coupled models including flux adjustment (which may have simply masked simulation errors), high horizontal resolution, and estimation of screen height temperature contributed to improved simulation of long-term surface climate. The large range of model responses was partly accounted for by inconsistencies in forcing scenarios and transient-simulation averaging periods. Nonetheless, the models generally had greater agreement in their sensitivities than their controls did with observations. This suggests that consistent, large-scale response features from an ensemble of model sensitivity experiments may not depend on details of their representation of present-day climate.},

With the model simulating realistic evaporation but underestimated precipitation, a deficit in soil moisture results which amplifies the initial temperature bias through feedbacks with the land surface.

A relatively overlooked aspect of this uncertainty pertains to how different methods of estimating potential evapotranspiration (PET) respond to changing climate. Here we investigate the global response of six different PET methods to a 2°C rise in global mean temperature. All methods suggest an increase in PET associated with a warming climate. However, differences in PET climate change signal of over 100\% are found between methods. Analysis of a precipitation/PET aridity index and regional water surplus indicates that for certain regions and GCMs, choice of PET method can actually determine the direction of projections of future water resources. As such, method dependence of the PET climate change signal is an important source of uncertainty in projections of future freshwater availability.},

For assessing the changes in the occurrence of hydrologic extremes, downscaled climate change signals in daily precipitation and runoff that are likely to indicate the occurrence of extreme events are examined. Downscaled climate change signals in the selected indicators suggest that the global warming induced by increased CO2 is likely to increase extreme hydrologic events in the WUS. The indicators for heavy precipitation events show largest increases in the mountainous regions of the northern California Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada. Increased cold season precipitation and increased rainfall-portion of precipitation at the expense of snowfall in the projected warmer climate result in large increases in high runoff events in the Sierra Nevada river basins that are already prone to cold season flooding in today's climate. The projected changes in the hydrologic characteristics in the WUS are mainly associated with higher freezing levels in the warmer climate and increases in the cold season water vapor influx from the Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Regional-scale projections of climate change signals due to increases in atmospheric CO2 are generated for the western United States using a regional climate model (RCM) nested within two global scenarios from a GCM. The downscaled control climate improved the local accuracy of the GCM results substantially. The downscaled control climate is reasonably close to the results of an 8-yr regional climate hindcast using the same RCM nested within the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, despite wet biases in high-elevation regions along the Pacific coast.
The downscaled near-surface temperature signal ranges from 3 to 5 K in the western United States. The projected warming signals generally increase with increasing elevation, consistent with earlier studies for the Swiss Alps and the northwestern United States. In addition to the snow-albedo feedback, seasonal variations of the low-level flow and soil moisture appear to play important roles in the spatial pattern of warming signals. Projected changes in precipitation characteristics are mainly associated with increased moisture fluxes from the Pacific Ocean and the increase in elevation of freezing levels during the cold season. Projected cold season precipitation increases substantially in mountainous areas along the Pacific Ocean. Most of the projected precipitation increase over the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades is in rainfall, while snowfall generally decreases except above 2500 m. Projected changes in summer rainfall are small. The snow budget signals are characterized by decreased (increased) cold season snowfall (snowmelt) and reduced snowmelt during spring and summer. The projected cold season runoff from high-elevation regions increases substantially in response to increased cold season rainfall and snowmelt, while the spring runoff decreases due to an earlier depletion of snow, except above 2500 m.},

The boundary conditions were supplied from twice-daily European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses at 2.5 degrees resolution for the period 1980-94, which were taken as the output of a "perfect" climate model. Daily and monthly estimates of minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation From both techniques were validated against readings from a network of 78 climate stations. The statistical estimates were made by a screening regression technique using the EOFs of the regional height fields at 1000 and 500 hPa, and local variables derived from these fields, as predictors. The model interpolations made use of the RAMS model developed at Colorado State University running at 50-km resolution for 1990-94 only. The model values at the nearest grid point to each station were rescaled using a simple linear regression to give the best fit to the station values. The results show both methods to have comparable skill in estimating daily and monthly station anomalies of temperatures and rainfall. Statistical estimates of monthly departures were better obtained directly from monthly mean forcing than from a combination of daily estimates; however, daily values are needed if one wishes to estimate variability. While there are good physical grounds for using the modeling technique to estimate the likely effects of climate change, the statistical technique requires considerably less computational effort and may be preferred for many applications.},

Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds. Our analysis shows that if salinity were to continue to increase at its present rate due to changes in impervious surface coverage and current management practices, many surface waters in the northeastern United States would not be potable for human consumption and would become toxic to freshwater life within the next century.},

	abstract = {The statistics of extremes have played an important role in engineering practice for water resources design and management. How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper. Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere-ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamflow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere-ocean circulation (e.g., El Nino phenomenon).

	abstract = {Analyses of mixtures of stochastic processes have begun to appear in climate research in recent years. Some general properties of mixtures that are well known within statistics, but not ordinarily utilized in complete generality in climate applications, are reviewed. How these issues apply in certain types of statistical downscaling is described. An important distinction is drawn between 'conditional' models, sometimes utilized in downscaling, and 'unconditional' models, utilized in more traditional approaches. Through a combination of the individual conditional models, a single overall (or 'induced') model is obtained. Among other things, the mixture concept suggests physically plausible mechanisms by which more complex stochastic models could arise in climate applications. As an application, the stochastic modeling of time series of daily precipitation amount conditional on a monthly index of large- (or regional) scale atmospheric circulation patterns is considered. Chain-dependent processes are used both as conditional and unconditional models of precipitation. For illustrative purposes, precipitation measurements for a site in California, USA, were fitted. How the mixture approach can aid in determining the properties of climate change scenarios produced by downscaling is demonstrated in this example. In particular, changes in the relative frequency of occurrence of the states of the circulation index would be associated not just with changes in mean precipitation, but with changes in its variance as well.},

This sensitivity analysis is guided by some results from statistical downscaling that relate patterns in large-scale atmospheric circulation to local precipitation, providing a physically plausible range of changes in the parameters.

	volume = {79},

	abstract = {Twentieth century trends of precipitation are examined by a variety of methods to more fully describe how precipitation has changed or varied. Since 1910, precipitation has increased by about 10\% across the contiguous United States. The increase in precipitation is reflected primarily in the heavy and extreme daily precipitation events. For example, over half (53\%) of the total increase of precipitation is due to positive trends in the upper 10 percentiles of the precipitation distribution. These trends are highly significant, both practically and statistically. The increase has arisen for two reasons. First, an increase in the frequency of days with precipitation [6 days (100 yr)(-1)] has occurred for all categories of precipitation amount. Second, for the extremely heavy precipitation events, an increase in the intensity of the events is also significantly contributing (about half) to the precipitation increase. As a result, there is a significant trend in much of the United States of the highest daily year-month precipitation amount, but with no systematic national trend of the median precipitation amount.
These data suggest that the precipitation regimes in the United States are changing disproportionately across the precipitation distribution. The proportion of total precipitation derived from extreme and heavy events is increasing relative to more moderate events. These changes have an impact on the area of the United States affected by a much above-normal (upper 10 percentile) proportion of precipitation derived from very heavy precipitation events, for example, daily precipitation events exceeding 50.8 mm (2 in.).},

Circulation patterns (CPs) characterizing the weather in the region are defined based on wind direction and on barometric conditions and the modification of the large-scale atmospheric variables (geopotential height, occurrence probability and duration of CPs) in 2 x CO2-case is estimated. The effect of the atmospheric-variables modification on temperature and precipitation on basin scale is predicted by means of a semiempirical, purely circulation-based downscaling model. Temperature modification in 2 x CO2-case has been found to be significant for eight months of the year with a maximal increase of mean monthly temperature approximately 2 degreesC. For precipitation, significant change has been predicted for one of the precipitation stations considered. Owing to the fact that this precipitation change does not influence mean precipitation of the basin, climate change impact on basin runoff has been investigated only for temperature effects. For this purpose a hydrological model has been used. It has been found that the error of hydrologic model is significantly larger than climate change impact so that modifications of the river basin hydrology for the 2 x CO2-case can be hardly predicted.

Confidence in projected regional changes is based on the ability of a range of models to simulate present regional climate, and is greatest where intermodel consensus in terms of the nature of projected changes is highest. Both equilibrium and transient climate change projections for southern Africa are considered. Warming projected over southern Africa is within the range of globally averaged estimates. Uncertainties associated with the parameterization of convection ensure that projected changes in rainfall at GCM grid scales remain unreliable. However, empirical downscaling approaches produce rainfall changes consistent with synoptic-scale circulation. Both downscaling and grid-scale approaches indicate a 10-15\% decrease in summer rainfall over the central interior which may have important implications for surface hydrology. Climate change may be manifested as a change in variability, and not in mean climate. Over southern Africa, increases in the variability and intensity of daily rainfall events are indicated.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric circulations, and related climate conditions, exert a strong influence on the transport and ultimate deposition of atmospheric pollutants. One potential outcome of climate change is alteration of atmospheric circulation patterns. The first stage in the development of a downscaling methodology to assess the influence of these possible future atmospheric circulation changes on transport and deposition of atmospheric pollutants over Europe is described. Firstly, the main modes of regional- scale circulation over a domain covering the North Atlantic and Europe are determined using principal components analysis of sea level pressure patterns. To determine whether the principal components represent circulation types found in reality, and show realistic relationships with surface temperature and precipitation amount, they are compared to the Lamb Weather Types, Central Eng land Temperature, and England and Wales Rainfall. There are statistically significant relationships between some of the principal components and aqueous and ambient pollutant concentrations at 5 selected stations from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme monitoring network. Although, for any one combination of principal component and pollutant variable, the level of explanation can be quite small, notwithstanding some levels of variance explained for individual combinations being up to 69 \% (45 \% for the winter season, described in detail here). Because the pollution climate at any one location is a function of many combinations of circulation/pollution relationships, despite the relatively small magnitude of variance explained for individual combinations in this study. the results confirm the utility of atmospheric circulation principal components in deriving downscaling relationships for surface pollution behaviour (via eventual multiple regressions, not reported in this paper), as well as giving further insight into the climatic influences on air and precipitation chemistry over Europe.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is expected that an increasing proportion of the precipitation will fall as rain in alpine catchments in the future. Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket-type catchment model, HBV-light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60–75\% for the period 2070–2099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40–90\% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50\% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer.},

	abstract = {A climate change scenario for the Nordic countries has been defined for application in hydrological models in the Nordic research project 'Climate Change and Energy Production'. The scenario is based on a subjective evaluation of several recent results from global coupled atmosphere and ocean general circulation models (GCMs) and on a statistical downscaling of the model results. The scenario specifies a warming rate which ranges from 0.3 degrees C per decade for Iceland and the Faeroe Islands to 0.45 degrees C per decade for eastern Finland and the northernmost parts of Sweden. There are marked seasonal and regional differences in the warming rate. Summer warming is relatively uniform over the area, ranging from 0.25 degrees C per decade in Iceland and the Faeroe Islands to 0.3 degrees C per decade in Finland. Winter warming is more variable, ranging from 0.35 degrees C per decade in the North Atlantic area to 0.6 degrees C per decade in Finland. Precipitation is increased by 3 to 6\% per degree of warming, yielding an increase ranging from 1\% per decade during the summer season in Finland, Sweden and eastern Norway to 2.5\% per decade during the winter season in western Norway. Climate in the Nordic countries is characterized by low-frequency natural variability on decadal time scales which is thought to be partly driven by changes in the thermohaline circulation of the North Atlantic. Future behaviour of the North Atlantic ocean circulation is highly uncertain, and model predictions of climate development in this part of the world are perhaps more difficult than for most other regions. Other sources of uncertainty in GCM model computations apply to the North Atlantic region as well as to other regions of the world, e.g. coarse model resolution, somewhat arbitrary coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere and uncertain parameterizations of clouds and precipitation. In view of these difficulties, the scenario must be considered an extremely uncertain, although plausible, description of what might happen in the future rather than a prediction of what most likely will happen.},

	abstract = {The time structure of simulated daily maximum and minimum temperature series, produced by several different methods, is compared with observations at six stations in central Europe. The methods are statistical downscaling, stochastic weather generator, and general circulation models (GCMs). Outputs from control runs of two GCMs are examined: ECHAM3 and CCCM2. Four time series are constructed by statistical downscaling using multiple linear regression of 500-hPa heights and 1000-/500-hPa thickness: (i) from observations with variance reproduced by the inflation technique, (ii) from observations with variance reproduced by adding a white noise process, and (iii) from the two GCMs. Two runs of the weather generator were performed, one considering and one neglecting the annual cycle of lag-0 and lag-1 correlations among daily weather characteristics. Standard deviation and skewness of day-to-day temperature changes and lag-1 autocorrelations are examined. For heat and cold waves, the occurrence frequency, mean duration, peak temperature, and mean position within the year are studied. Possible causes of discrepancies between the simulated and observed time series are discussed and identified. They are shown to stem, among others, from (i) the absence of physics in downscaled and stochastically generated series, (ii) inadequacies of treatment of physical processes in GCMs, (iii) assumptions of linearity in downscaling equations, and (iv) properties of the underlying statistical model of the weather generator. In downscaling, variance inflation is preferable to the white noise addition in most aspects as the latter results in highly overestimated day-to-day variability. The inclusion of the annual cycle of correlations into the weather generator does not lead to an overall improvement of the temperature series produced. None of the methods appears to be able to reproduce all the characteristics of time structure correctly.},

The method used is multiple lineal regression. Whereas precipitation can be determined from large-scale fields with some confidence in only a few months of the year, temperature can be determined successfully. Principal components calculated separately from the height and thickness anomalies are identified as the best predictor set. The method is most accurate if the regression is performed using seasons based on three months. The test on an independent sample, consisting of warm seasons, confirms that the method successfully reproduces the difference in mean temperature between two climatic states, which indicates that this downscaling method is applicable for constructing scenarios of a future climate change. The ECHAM3 GCM is used for scenario construction. The CCM is shown to simulate surface temperature and precipitation with low accuracy, whereas the large-scale atmospheric fields are reproduced well; this justifies the downscaling approach. The observed regression equations are applied to 2xCO(2) GCM output so that the model's bias is eleminated. This procedure is then discussed and finally, temperature scenarios for the 2xCO(2) climate are constructed for the two catchments.},

The methods comprise (i) canonical correlation analysis (CCA), (ii) singular value decomposition analysis, (iii) multiple linear regression (MLR) of predictor principal components (PCs) with stepwise screening, (iv) MLR of predictor PCs without screening (i. e., all PCs are forced to enter the regression model), and (v) MLR of gridpoint values with stepwise screening (pointwise regression). The potential predictors include two circulation variables (sea level pressure and 500-hPa heights) and two temperature variables (850-hPa temperature and 1000-500-hPa thickness). The methods are evaluated according to the accuracy of specification (in terms of rmse and variance explained), their temporal structure (characterized by lag-1 autocorrelations), and their spatial structure (characterized by spatial correlations and objectively defined divisions into homogeneous regions). The most accurate specification and best approximation of the temporal structure are achieved by the pointwise regression; the spatial structure is best captured by CCA. The best choice of predictors appears to be a pair of one circulation and one temperature predictor. Of the two ways of reproducing the original variance, inflation yields more realistic both temporal and spatial variability than randomization. The size of the domain on which predictors are defined plays a rather negligible role.},

The methods include canonical correlation analysis, singular value decomposition, and 3 multiple regression models. The potential large-scale predictors are 500 hPa heights, sea level pressure, 850 hPa temperature and 1000-500 hPa thickness. The performance of the methods is evaluated using cross- validation and root-mean-squared error as a measure of accuracy. The stepwise screening of gridpoint data is found to be the statistical model that performed the best. Among the predictors, temperature variables yield more accurate results than circulation variables. The best predictor is the combination of 500 hPa heights and 850 hPa temperature. Geographical variations of the specification skill, mainly the differences between the elevated and lowland stations, are also discussed.},

	title = {Disaggregating climatic trends by classification of circulation patterns},
	volume = {21},
	abstract = {The trends in occurrence frequencies of circulation types over Europe and in nine climate variables in the Czech Republic conditioned by the types are examined for period 1949-1980. The circulation types are determined by an objective procedure from daily 500 hPa heights. Both in summer and winter, anticyclonic types have become more frequent at the expense of cyclonic types. The circulation changes are shown to be unrelated to the trends in surface climate elements in summer, whereas in winter, trends in circulation explain a part of the observed warming and strengthening of southerly winds. The trends in climate elements are not uniform among circulation types. In summer, the trend pattern consisting of decreasing maximum and daily mean temperatures, daily temperature range (DTR) and sunshine duration, and increasing cloudiness and relative humidity is observed under the cyclonic types and the types with a well-pronounced jet, but is missing under types with a blocking anticyclone over Europe. Two possible mechanisms causing this trend pattern are proposed: increasing cloudiness, and a process responsible for the reduction of sunshine without a concurrent increase of cloudiness. The latter mechanism can possibly be identified with increasing aerosol concentrations. In winter, the degree of warming is governed by changes in zonal wind. The mechanism of change in DTR seems to vary with elevation: at the lowland station (Prague-Klementinum), the increase in DTR is related to the warming trend, and consequently with zonal wind changes, while at the mountain station (Milesovka), the increase in DTR reflects the increase in precipitating clouds. The changes in DTR are related much more to mid-tropospheric circulation than to cloud cover in summer, whereas in winter, cloud cover plays a more important role in affecting DTR trends.

All the methods proved to be capable of yielding meaningful classifications. None of them can be thought of as the best in all aspects.

	abstract = {In the Copenhagen Accord, nations agreed on the need to limit global warming to two degrees to avoid potentially dangerous climate change, while in policy circles negotiations have placed a particular emphasis on emissions in years 2020 and 2050. We investigate the link between the probability of global warming remaining below two degrees (above pre-industrial levels) right through to year 2500 and what this implies for emissions in years 2020 and 2050, and any long-term emissions floor. This is achieved by mapping out the consequences of alternative emissions trajectories, all in a probabilistic framework and with results placed in a simple-to-use set of graphics. The options available for carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions in years 2020 and 2050 are narrow if society wishes to stay, with a chance of more likely than not, below the 2 °C target. Since cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, and particularly CO 2 , are a key determinant of peak warming, the consequence of being near the top of emissions in the allowable range for 2020 is reduced flexibility in emissions in 2050 and higher required rates of societal decarbonization. Alternatively, higher 2020 emissions can be considered as reducing the probability of limiting warming to 2 °C. We find that the level of the long-term emissions floor has a strong influence on allowed 2020 and 2050 emissions for two degrees of global warming at a given probability. We place our analysis in the context of emissions pledges for year 2020 made at the end of and since the 2009 COP15 negotiations in Copenhagen.},

	volume = {95},
	abstract = {Dew point temperature (T-d) is a precise measure of atmospheric moisture. A significant number of models for studying crop- climate interactions and earth processes require daily T-d as an input. However, limited availability of T-d data is a major barrier for applications of these models. In this paper, we present a daily T-d estimation method for the northern Great Plains (NGP). The daily T-d estimation method presented here requires daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperature data. Data from six sites in the NGP were used for the study. These sites record hourly T-d data from relative humidity. Length of the time series is 14 yr (1986-1999). Four different regression-based approaches were adopted and applied to all sites. Eventually, the best method was adopted based on its performance. The model evaluation statistics show that the selected model performs satisfactorily for these six sites. For example, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and d index (ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates no model error) values for North Platte, NE, application are 3.23, 2.55, and 0.97, respectively. The selected method was further applied to five additional locations in the NGP, and again it performed satisfactorily. For example, RMSE, MAE, and d index values for McCook, NE, application are 2.6, 2.0, and 0.98, respectively. From the model evaluation, we conclude that the model performed satisfactorily and will be quite useful in estimating. T-d.},

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on grassland agriculture may affect yield, livestock numbers, winter housing, slurry storage and land spreading, and the production system. The potential change in grass yield in Ireland due to climate change was estimated using simulation modelling. The estimation took account of the spatial variation of soil and climate. The approach adopted was to: (i) use statistically downscaled climate data derived from the Hadley HADCM3 climate model; (ii) simulate daily weather for 30 separate years from monthly climate data (baseline, 2055 and 2075) using a stochastic weather generator; (iii) simulate 30 years of grass yields for each climate period using the Johnstown Castle Grass Model; (iv) summarize the 30 yield predictions for each climate period as a mean response to climate; and (v) quantify the change in yield as a result of climate change. Grass yield was predicted to decrease in the east of the country due to summer drought stress. In the west grass yield was predicted to increase. The major impacts of yield change were considered to be: (i) grass may cease to be a viable crop in the southeast and east if it requires irrigation to compensate for drought; (ii) theoretical turnout date may become earlier in the season; (iii) stock may have to remain housed at times when currently grazed outside, thus extending storage requirements; and (iv) alternative forage crops may become more suitable for winter feed conservation. No catastrophic impacts are foreseen, but the exact implications will also depend on regional agricultural policy.},

The comparisons were performed with daily mean temperature and daily precipitation amounts for the continental climate of the state of Nebraska, USA. Both the T21 and the T42 versions resulted in an increase of daily mean temperature under a 2 x CO2 climate. The magnitude of warming was substantially greater for T21 than for T42, except for February and June and at some stations in July where the T42 model suggested greater warming. Both GCMs resulted in a slight decrease in precipitation frequency and an increase in the amount of precipitation on wet days. Here, the T42 model again led to smaller changes. Different locations within Nebraska exhibited somewhat different temperature and precipitation responses with both GCM versions.},

End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.},

He assumes that the argument would be ?based on the belief that long-term trends and along with them future climate signals are to be large scale.? His line of argument reverts to the so-called inflated regression. Here it is shown, by referring to previous critiques of inflation and standard literature in statistical modeling as well as weather forecasting, that inflation is built upon a wrong understanding of explained versus unexplained variability and prediction versus simulation. It is argued that a sound regression-based downscaling can in principle introduce systematic local variability in long-term trends, but inflation systematically deteriorates the representation of trends. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that inflation by construction deteriorates weather forecasts and is not able to correctly simulate small-scale spatiotemporal structure.},

This assumption is assessed for regional climate models in a pseudo reality for seasonal mean temperature and precipitation sums. An ensemble of regional climate models for Europe is used, all driven with the same transient boundary conditions. Although this model-dependent approach does not assess all possible bias non-stationarities, conclusions can be drawn for the real world. Generally, biases are relatively stable, and bias correction on average improves climate scenarios. For winter temperature, bias changes occur in the Alps and ice covered oceans caused by a biased forcing sensitivity of surface albedo; for summer temperature, bias changes occur due to a biased sensitivity of cloud cover and soil moisture. Precipitation correction is generally successful, but affected by internal variability in arid climates. As model sensitivities vary considerably in some regions, multi model ensembles are needed even after bias correction.},

Considering that the design of urban drainage systems is based on statistical analysis of past events, an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events will most probably result in more frequent flooding. The design criteria must therefore be revised to take into consideration possible changes induced by climate change. A procedure is proposed to revise the design criteria of urban drainage infrastructures. This procedure integrates information about (1) climate projections for extreme rainfall over the region under consideration; (2) expected level of performance (or acceptable level of risk); and (3) expected lifetime of the infrastructure/system. The resulting design criterion ensures that the service level remains above the selected "acceptable" level over a predefined portion of the infrastructure lifetime. It is argued that the definition of new design criteria should be part of a global adaptation strategy combining various measures to maintain an acceptable level of service in a long-term perspective. Defining this level of service is however a challenge in a context where uncertainties on projected changes in intense rainfall are still important.},

For a signal to become obvious in data records or in a human lifetime it needs to be greater than the noise of variability and thereby lead to a significant shift in the distribution of temperature. We show that locations with the largest amount of warming may not display a clear shift in temperature distributions if the local variability is also large. Based on observational data only we demonstrate that large parts of the Earth have experienced a significant local shift towards warmer temperatures in the summer season, particularly at lower latitudes. We also show that these regions are similar to those that are found to be significant in standard detection methods, thus providing an approach to link locally significant changes more closely to impacts.},

	abstract = {Reducing uncertainty in climate projections can involve giving less credence to Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for which the simulated future climate is judged to be unreliable. Reliability is commonly assessed by comparing AOGCM output with observations. A desirable property of any AOGCM skill score is that resulting AOGCM-performance rankings should show some consistency when derived using observations from different time periods. Notably, earlier work has demonstrated inconsistency between rankings obtained for 20-year periods in the 20th century based on global and regional comparisons of simulated and observed near-surface temperature anomalies. Here, we demonstrate that AOGCM-performance rankings derived from actual temperatures, which incorporate AOGCM biases in climatological means, can be used to identify AOGCMs that perform consistently well or poorly across multiple 20-year periods in the 20th century. This result supports the use of comparisons of simulated and observed actual values of climate variables when assessing the reliability of AOGCMs. Citation: Macadam, I., A. J. Pitman, P. H.

	abstract = {Abstract The annual cycle of precipitation over the southern part of Mexico and Central America exhibits a bimodal distribution with maxima during June and September–October and a relative minimum during July and August, known as the midsummer drought (MSD). The MSD is not associated with the meridional migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and its double crossing over Central America but rather with fluctuations in the intensity and location of the eastern Pacific ITCZ. During the transition from intense to weak (weak to intense) convective activity, the trade winds over the Caribbean strengthen (weaken). Such acceleration in the trade winds is part of the dynamic response of the low-level atmosphere to the magnitude of the convective forcing in the ITCZ. The intensification of the trade winds during July and August and the orographic forcing of the mountains over most of Central America result in maximum precipitation along the Caribbean coast and minimum precipitation along the Pacific coast of Central America. Changes in the divergent (convergent) low-level winds over the “warm pool” off the west coast of southern Mexico and Central America determine the evolution of the MSD. Maximum deep convective activity over the northern equatorial eastern Pacific, during the onset of the summer rainy season, is reached when sea surface temperatures exceed 29°C (around May). After this, the SSTs over the eastern Pacific warm pool decrease around 1°C due to diminished downwelling solar radiation and stronger easterly winds (during July and August). Such SST changes near 28°C result in an substantial decrease in deep convective activity, associated with the nonlinear interaction between SST and deep tropical convection. Decreased deep tropical convection allows increased downwelling solar radiation and a slight increase in SSTs, which reach a second maximum (∼28.5°C) by the end of August and early September. This increase in SST results once again in stronger low-level convergence, enhanced deep convection, and, consequently, in a second maximum in precipitation. The MSD signal can also be detected in other variables such as minimum and maximum surface temperature and even in tropical cyclone activity over the eastern Pacific.},

The model is based on the partial duration series (PDS) method that includes in the analysis all events above a threshold level. In the PDS model the average annual number of exceedances, the mean value of the exceedance magnitudes, and the coefficient of L variation (LCV) are considered as regional variables. A generalized least squares (GLS) regression model that explicitly accounts for intersite correlation and sampling uncertainties is applied for evaluating the regional heterogenity of the PDS parameters. For the parameters that show a significant regional variability the GLS model is subsequently adopted for describing the variability from physiographic and climatic characteristics. For determination of a proper regional parent distribution L moment analysis is applied for discriminating between the exponential distribution and various two-parameter distributions in the PDS model. The resulting model can be used for estimation of rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves at an arbitrary location in a region. For illustration, the regional model is applied to rainfall data from a rain gauge network in Denmark.},

As phenological data we have chosen the beginning of the flowering of Galanthus nivalis L.

By means of canonical cell-elation analysis (CCA), a strong linear correlation between both sets of variables is identified. Twenty years of observed data are used to build the statistical model. To validate the derived relationship, the flowering date is downscaled from air temperature observations of an independent period. The statistical model is found to reproduce the observed flowering dates well, both in terms of variability as well as amplitude. Air temperature data from a general circulation model of climate change are used to estimate the flowering date in the case of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. We found that at a time of doubled CO2 concentration (expected by about 2035) G. nivalis L. in Northern Germany will flower similar to 2 weeks and at the time of tripled CO2 concentration (expected by about 2085) similar to 4 weeks earlier than presently.},

	abstract = {Short-term climate and weather systems can have a strong influence on mountain snowmelt, sometimes overwhelming the effects of elevation and aspect. Although most years exhibit a spring onset that starts first at lowest and moves to highest elevations, in spring 2002, flow in a variety of streams within the Tuolumne and Merced River basins of the southern Sierra Nevada all rose synchronously on 29 March. Flow in streams draining small high-altitude glacial subcatchments rose at the same time as that draining much larger basins gauged at lower altitudes, and streams from north- and south-facing cirques rose and fell together. Historical analysis demonstrates that 2002 was one among only 8 yr with such synchronous flow onsets during the past 87 yr, recognized by having simultaneous onsets of snowmelt at over 70\% of snow pillow sites, having discharge in over 70\% of monitored streams increase simultaneously, and having temperatures increase over 12degreesC within a 5-day period. Synchronous springs tend to begin with a low pressure trough over California during late winter, followed by the onset of a strong ridge and unusually warm temperatures. Synchronous springs are characterized by warmer than average winters and cooler than average March temperatures in California. In the most elevation-dependent, nonsynchronous years, periods of little or no storm activity, with warmer than average March temperatures, precede the onset of spring snowmelt, allowing elevation and aspect to influence snowmelt as spring arrives gradually.},

However, there is relatively little attention paid to whether, should a dangerous temperature level be exceeded, it is feasible for the global temperature to then return to safer levels in a usefully short time. We focus on the timescales needed to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases and associated temperatures back below potentially dangerous thresholds, using a state-of-the-art general circulation model. This analysis is extended with a simple climate model to provide uncertainty bounds. We find that even for very large reductions in emissions, temperature reduction is likely to occur at a low rate. Policy-makers need to consider such very long recovery timescales implicit in the Earth system when formulating future emission pathways that have the potential to 'overshoot' particular atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and, more importantly, related temperature levels that might be considered dangerous.},

In winter, a teleconnection (see-saw) between western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean at the 850 hPa level is revealed, and a corresponding weaker one between the areas of central-west and eastern Mediterranean for SST. The correlation between T-850hPa and SST appears higher over the eastern Mediterranean. In summer, the first pair of canonical variates reveals a covariability between T-850hPa and SST in the western Mediterranean, and the second one shows a covariability in the eastern Mediterranean, without the existence of any strong spatial teleconnection. The analysis is repeated, using time lags of I month, or longer, in order to detect any possible non-synchronous relation. Statistically significant results are found only when T-850hPa leads SST with a time lag of I month. In particular, the results are statistically significant for winter only, and the findings are similar to those of the first analysis. Therefore, the existence of a I month time scale SST persistence is detected for winter months. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {This paper is part of a series of papers about the multi-institutional North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) project. It compares and evaluates streamflow and water balance results from four different land surface models (LSMs) within the continental United States. These LSMs have been run for the retrospective period from 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999 forced by atmospheric observations from the Eta Data Assimilation System (EDAS) analysis, measured precipitation, and satellite-derived downward solar radiation. These model runs were performed on a common 1/8Â° latitude-longitude grid and used the same database for soil and vegetation classifications. We have evaluated these simulations using U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured daily streamflow data for 9 large major basins and 1145 small- to medium-sized basins from 23 km2 to 10,000 km2 distributed over the NLDAS domain. Model runoff was routed with a common distributed and a lumped optimized linear routing model. The diagnosis of the model water balance results demonstrates strengths and weaknesses in the models, our insufficient knowledge of ad hoc parameters used for the model runs, the interdependence of model structure and model physics, and the lack of good forcing data in parts of the United States, especially in regions with extended snow cover. Overall, the differences between the LSM water balance terms are of the same magnitude as the mean water balance terms themselves. The modeled mean annual runoff shows large regional differences by a factor of up to 4 between models. The corresponding difference in mean annual evapotranspiration is about a factor of 2. The analysis of runoff timing for the LSMs demonstrates the importance of correct snowmelt timing, where the resulting differences in streamflow timing can be up to four months. Runoff is underestimated by all LSMs in areas with significant snowfall.},

The third approach is based on the empirical-statistical methodology and is developed in this paper. This approach allows to decide two main problems: to give a real assessment of climate changes by observed data for climate monitoring and extrapolation of obtained climate tendencies to the nearest future (10-15 years) and give the empirical basis for further development of physic-mathematical models. The basic theory and methodology of empirical-statistic approach have been developed as well as a common model for description of space-time climate variations taking into account the processes of different time scales. The way of decreasing of the present and future uncertainty is suggested as the extraction of long-term climate changes components in the particular time series and spatial generalization of the same climate tendencies in the obtained homogeneous regions. Algorithm and methods for realization of empirical-statistic methodology have been developed along with methods for generalization of intraannual fluctuations, methods for extraction of homogeneous components of different time scales (interannual, decadal, century), methodology and methods for spatial generalization and modeling, methods for extrapolation on the basis of two main kinds of time models: stochastic and deterministic-stochastic. Some applications of developed methodology and methods are given for the longest time series of temperature and precipitation over the world and for spatial generalization over the European area.},

Seasonal models were built for each of 2 US sites: San Francisco, California, and San Antonio, Texas. The average correlation between observed and simulated daily precipitation data series is 0.75 for the training set and 0.68 for the validation set. Relative humidity was found to be the dominant variable in these TSR models. Output from an NCAR CSM (climate system model) transient simulation of climate change were then used to drive the TSR models in the prediction of precipitation characteristics under climate change. A preliminary screening of the GCM output variables for current climate, however, revealed significant problems for the San Antonio site. Specifically, the CSM missed the annual trends in humidity for the grid cell containing this site. CSM output for the San Francisco site was found to be much more reliable. Therefore, we present future precipitation estimates only for the San Francisco site.},

	doi = {10.1029/2009jd012882},
	abstract = {A new quantile-based mapping method is developed for the bias correction of monthly global circulation model outputs. Compared to the widely used quantile-based matching method that assumes stationarity and only uses the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the model and observations for the baseline period, the proposed method incorporates and adjusts the model CDF for the projection period on the basis of the difference between the model and observation CDFs for the training (baseline) period. Thus, the method explicitly accounts for distribution changes for a given model between the projection and baseline periods. We demonstrate the use of the new method over northern Eurasia. We fit a four-parameter beta distribution to monthly temperature fields and discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of distribution range parameters. For monthly precipitation data, a mixed gamma distribution is used that accounts for the intermittent nature of rainfall. To test the fidelity of the proposed method, we choose 1970\&\#8211;1999 as the baseline training period and then randomly select 30 years from 1901\&\#8211;1999 as the projection test period. The bootstrapping is repeated 30 times to mimic different climate conditions that may occur, and the results suggest that both methods are comparable when applied to the 20th century for both temperature and precipitation for the examined quartiles. We also discuss the dependence of the bias correction results on the choice of time period for training. This indicates that the remaining biases in the bias-corrected time series are directly tied to the model's performance during the training period, and therefore care should be taken when using a particular training time period. When applied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report (AR4) A2 climate scenario projection, the data time series after bias correction from both methods exhibit similar spatial patterns. However, over regions where the climate model shows large changes in projected variability, there are discernable differences between the methods. The proposed method is more sensitive to a reduction in variability, exemplified by wintertime temperature. Further synthetic experiments using the lower 33\% and upper 33\% of the full data set as the validation data suggest that the proposed equidistance quantile-matching method is more efficient in reducing biases than the traditional CDF mapping method for changing climates, especially for the tails of the distribution. This has important consequences for the occurrence and intensity of future projected extreme events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. As the new method is simple to implement and does not require substantial computational time, it can be used to produce auxiliary ensemble scenarios for various climate impact-oriented applications.},

The critical role of snow in water supply has been frequently quantified using the ratio of snowmelt-derived runoff to total runoff. However, current estimates of the fraction of annual runoff generated by snowmelt are not based on systematic analyses. Here based on hydrological model simulations and a new snowmelt tracking algorithm, we show that 53\% of the total runoff in the western United States originates as snowmelt, despite only 37\% of the precipitation falling as snow. In mountainous areas, snowmelt is responsible for 70\% of the total runoff. By 2100, the contribution of snowmelt to runoff will decrease by one third for the western U.S. in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Snowmelt-derived runoff currently makes up two thirds of the inflow to the region's major reservoirs. We argue that substantial impacts on water supply are likely in a warmer climate.},

	abstract = {Global climate change due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has serious potential impacts on water resources in the Pacific Northwest. Climate scenarios produced by general circulation models (GCMs) do not provide enough spatial specificity for studying water resources in mountain watersheds. This study uses dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The RCM results indicate an average warming of about 2.5 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate, there is a 60 percent reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is only reduced by 18 percent and the seasonal pattern of streamflow remains intact. This study shows that the impacts of climate change on water resources are highly region specific. Furthermore, under the specific climate change scenario, the impacts are largely driven by the warming trend rather than the precipitation trend, which is small.},

	abstract = {To study the impacts of climate change on water resources in the western U. S., global climate simulations were produced using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy (NCAR/DOE) Parallel Climate Model (PCM). The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used to downscale the PCM control ( 20 years) and three future ( 2040 - 2060) climate simulations to yield ensemble regional climate simulations at 40 km spatial resolution for the western U. S. This paper describes the regional simulations and focuses on the hydroclimate conditions in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) and Sacramento- San Joaquin River (SSJ) Basin. Results based on global and regional simulations show that by mid-century, the average regional warming of 1 to 2.5 degreesC strongly affects snowpack in the western U. S. Along coastal mountains, reduction in annual snowpack was about 70\% as indicated by the regional simulations. Besides changes in mean temperature, precipitation, and snowpack, cold season extreme daily precipitation increased by 5 to 15 mm/day (15 - 20\%) along the Cascades and the Sierra. The warming resulted in increased rainfall at the expense of reduced snowfall, and reduced snow accumulation ( or earlier snowmelt) during the cold season. In the CRB, these changes were accompanied by more frequent rain-on-snow events. Overall, they induced higher likelihood of wintertime flooding and reduced runoff and soil moisture in the summer. Changes in surface water and energy budgets in the CRB and SSJ basin were affected mainly by changes in surface temperature, which were statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level. Changes in precipitation, while spatially incoherent, were not statistically significant except for the drying trend during summer. Because snow and runoff are highly sensitive to spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation, this study shows that ( 1) downscaling provides more realistic estimates of hydrologic impacts in mountainous regions such as the western U. S., and ( 2) despite relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation, changes in snowpack and runoff can be much larger on monthly to seasonal time scales because the effects of temperature and precipitation are integrated over time and space through various surface hydrological and land-atmosphere feedback processes. Although the results reported in this study were derived from an ensemble of regional climate simulations driven by a global climate model that displays low climate sensitivity compared with most other models, climate change was found to significantly affect water resources in the western U. S. by the mid twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {The regional climate of the western United States shows clear footprints of interaction between atmospheric circulation and orography. The unique features of this diverse climate regime challenges climate modeling. This paper provides detailed analyses of observations and regional climate simulations to improve our understanding and modeling of the climate of this region. The primary data used in this study are the 1/8degrees gridded temperature and precipitation based on station observations and the NCEP - NCAR global reanalyses. These data were used to evaluate a 20-yr regional climate simulation performed using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University - National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State - NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) driven by large-scale conditions of the NCEP - NCAR reanalyses. Regional climate features examined include seasonal mean and extreme precipitation; distribution of precipitation rates; and precipitation intensity, frequency, and seasonality. The relationships between precipitation and surface temperature are also analyzed as a means to evaluate how well regional climate simulations can be used to simulate surface hydrology, and relationships between precipitation and elevation are analyzed as diagnostics of the impacts of surface topography and spatial resolution. The latter was performed at five east - west transects that cut across various topographic features in the western United States.
These analyses suggest that the regional simulation realistically captures many regional climate features. The simulated seasonal mean and extreme precipitation are comparable to observations. The regional simulation produces precipitation over a wide range of precipitation rates comparable to observations. Obvious biases in the simulation include the oversimulation of precipitation in the basins and intermountain West during the cold season, and the undersimulation in the Southwest in the warm season. There is a tendency of reduced precipitation frequency rather than intensity in the simulation during the summer in the Northwest and Southwest, which leads to the insufficient summer mean precipitation in those areas. Because of the general warm biases in the simulation, there is also a tendency for more precipitation events to be associated with warmer temperatures, which can affect the simulation of snowpack and runoff.},

	abstract = {Natural fluctuations in the atmosphere-ocean system related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induce climate variability over many parts of the world that is potentially predictable with lead times from seasons to decades. This study examines the potential of using a model nesting approach to provide seasonal climate and streamflow forecasts suitable for water resources management. Two ensembles of perpetual January simulations were performed with a regional climate model driven by a general circulation model (GCM), using observed climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and the mean SST of the warm ENSO years between 1950 and 1994. The climate simulations were then used to drive a macroscale hydrology model to simulate streamflow. The differences between the two ensembles of simulations are defined as the warm ENSO signals.
The simulated hydroclimate signals were compared with observations. The analyses focus on the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest. Results show that the global and regional models simulated a warming over the Pacific Northwest that is quite close to the observations. The models also correctly captured the strong wet signal over California and the weak dry signal over the Pacific Northwest during warm ENSO years. The regional climate model consistently performed better than the GCM in simulating the spatial distribution of regional climate and climate signals. When the climate simulations were used to drive a macroscale hydrology model at the Columbia River basin, the simulated streamflow signal resembles that derived from hydrological simulations driven by observed climate. The streamflow simulations were considerably improved when a simple bias correction scheme was applied to the climate simulations. The coupled regional climate and macroscale hydrologic simulations demonstrate the prospect for generating and utilizing seasonal climate forecasts for managing reservoirs.},

	title = {Water resources implications of global warming: {A} {US} regional perspective},
	volume = {43},
	abstract = {The implications of global warming for the performance of six U.S. water resource systems are evaluated. The six case study sites represent a range of geographic and hydrologic, as well as institutional and social settings. Large, multi-reservoir systems (Columbia River, Missouri River, Apalachicola- Chatahoochee-Flint (ACF) Rivers), small, one or two reservoir systems (Tacoma and Boston) and medium size systems (Savannah River) are represented. The river basins range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid, and the system operational purposes range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose. The studies inferred, using a chain of climate downscaling, hydrologic and water resources systems models, the sensitivity of six water resources systems to changes in precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. The climate change scenarios used in this study are based on results from transient climate change experiments performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs was also used in the evaluation. The GCM scenarios were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scales local weather variables by fixed monthly ratios (for precipitation) and fixed monthly shifts (for temperature). For those river basins where snow plays an important role in the current climate hydrology (Tacoma, Columbia, Missouri and, to a lesser extent, Boston) changes in temperature result in important changes in seasonal streamflow hydrographs. In these systems, spring snowmelt peaks are reduced and winter flows increase, on average. Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volumes more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs. In the Savannah and ACF systems, where snow plays a minor hydrological role, changes in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation changes. Effects on system performance varied from system to system, from GCM to GCM, and for each system operating objective (such as hydropower production, municipal and industrial supply, flood control, recreation, navigation and instream flow protection). Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenarios than for the doubled CO2 scenario. In terms of streamflow, one of the transient scenarios tended to have increases at most sites, while another tended to have decreases at most sites. The third showed no general consistency over the six sites. Generally, the water resource system performance effects were determined by the hydrologic changes and the amount of buffering provided by the system's storage capacity. The effects of demand growth and other plausible future operational considerations were evaluated as well. For most sites, the effects of these non-climatic effects on future system performance would about equal or exceed the effects of climate change over system planning horizons.},

	abstract = {A model nesting approach has been used to simulate the regional climate over the Pacific Northwest. The present-day global climatology is first simulated using the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3) driven by observed sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution at T42 (2.8 degrees) resolution. This large-scale simulation is used to provide lateral boundary conditions for driving the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Regional Climate Model (RCM). One notable feature of the RCM is the use of subgrid parameterizations of orographic precipitation and vegetation cover, in which subgrid variations of surface elevation and vegetation are aggregated to a limited number of elevation-vegetation classes. An airflow model and a thermodynamic model are used to parameterize the orographic uplift/descent as air parcels cross over mountain barriers or valleys.
The 7-yr climatologies as simulated by CCM3 and RCM are evaluated and compared in terms of large-scale spatial patterns and regional means. Biases are found in the simulation of large-scale circulations, which also affect the regional model simulation. Therefore, the regional simulation is not very different from the CCM3 simulation in terms of large-scale features. However, the regional model greatly improves the simulation of precipitation, surface temperature, and snow cover at the local scales. This is shown by improvements in the spatial correlation between the observations and simulations. The RCM simulation is further evaluated using station observations of surface temperature and precipitation to compare the simulated and observed relationships between surface temperature-precipitation and altitude. The model is found to correctly capture the surface temperature-precipitation variations as functions of surface topography over different mountain ranges, and under different climate regimes.},

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {The recent advent of climate simulations using physically based general circulation models (GCMs) provides a method of generating future climate scenarios to evaluate the reliability of surface water resources. Using GCMs, the hydrologic sensitivities of four medium-sized mountainous catchments in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins to long-term global warming were analyzed. The study catchments were selected to represent the geographic, climatic, and hydrologic diversity of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin. In addition, the following selection criteria were used: (1) diversions and storage upstream of the gaging station should be minimal; (2) the stream gage should be rated ' good ' or better, with the record including the years 1951-1980; and (3) the annual runoff should be highly correlated with the summed annual inflows to the reservoir system. The hydrologic response of these catchments, all of which are dominated by spring snowmelt runoff , were simulated by the coupling of the snowmelt and the soil moisture accounting models of the U.S. National Weather Service River Forecast System. In all four catchments the global warming pattern, which was indexed to CO2 doubling scenarios simulated by three (global) general circulation models, produced a major seasonal shift in the snow accumulation pattern. Under the alternative climate scenarios more winter precipitation fell as rain instead of snow, and winter runoff increased while spring snowmelt runoff decreased. In addition, large increases in the annual flood maxima were simulated, primarily due to an increase in rain-on-snow events, with the time of occurrence of many large floods shifting from spring to winter.

	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to be one of the greatest drivers of ecological change in the coming century. Increases in temperature over the last century have clearly been linked to shifts in species distributions. Given the magnitude of projected future climatic changes, we can expect even larger range shifts in the coming century. These changes will, in turn, alter ecological communities and the functioning of ecosystems. Despite the seriousness of predicted climate change, the uncertainty in climate-change projections makes it difficult for conservation managers and planners to proactively respond to climate stresses. To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. Eighty percent of the climate projections based on a relatively low greenhouse-gas emissions scenario result in the local loss of at least 10\% of the vertebrate fauna over much of North and South America. The largest changes in fauna are predicted for the tundra, Central America, and the Andes Mountains where, assuming no dispersal constraints, specific areas are likely to experience over 90\% turnover, so that faunal distributions in the future will bear little resemblance to those of today.},

Cross-validation and maps of modeled climate patterns are used as a criteria to assess particular climate realizations. The results of the exercise show how an agro-climatologist might use these methods to assess spatial representations of the modeled phenomena, the relevance of covariates, and the shortcomings and strengths of different techniques to characterize lake-physiography-climate interactions on a seasonal basis.

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to downscale large-scale circulation forecasts by the Centre for Ocean-Land- Atmosphere studies (COLA) T30 general circulation model (GCM) statistically to regional rainfall in South Africa. Monthly GCM ensemble forecasts available from 1979 to 1995 have been generated using NCEP reanalysis data as initial input and globally observed sea-surface temperature (SST) data at the lower boundary. Altogether, 51 30-day cases of CCM simulations, spanning 17 years, within the target season of December- February (DJF), are produced. This period is very important for agriculture and maize, in particular. A model output statistics (MOS) procedure is used to downscale GCM forecast sea-level pressure and 500 hPa height fields to regional rainfall for 30- day periods over South Africa. The CCA model is trained on the first 31 cases (up to February 1989) and forecasts are subsequently made for the remaining 20 cases. These retro- active real-time forecasts have a high potential (correlations {\textgreater} 0.5) over most of the interior of South Africa and, furthermore, the prediction of extreme events seems feasible. CCA diagnostics of the GCM-output against rainfall reveal that favourable rainfall over most of the interior is associated with low pressure systems at the surface over the west coast, with an associated ridging high. This is supported by other observational studies. Copyright (C) 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	volume = {252},
	abstract = {A multi-tiered forecast procedure is employed to simulate real- time operational seasonal forecasts of categorized (below- normal, near-normal and above-normal) streamflow at the inlets of twelve dams of the Vaal and upper Tugela river catchments in South Africa. Forecasts are made for the December to February (DJF) season over an 8-year independent period from 1987/ 1988 to 1994/1995. A physically based model of the atmosphere system, known as a general circulation model (GCM), is used to simulate atmospheric variability over southern Africa, the output of which is statistically downscaled to streamflow. The GCM used is the COLA T30, and is forced at the boundary with predicted monthly-mean global sea-surface temperatures. The monthly-mean sea-surface temperature fields are first predicted over lead-times of several months using a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) model. GCM simulations are then obtained for an area including most of southern Africa and adjacent oceans. The GCM simulations are downscaled to catchment level from coarse resolution gridded climate variables, using a perfect prognosis approach: bias-corrected GCM simulations are substituted into the perfect prognosis equations to provide the downscaled categorized streamflow forecasts. Although surface characteristics of each catchment that affect the variability of streamflow are not considered in the proposed downscaling system, successful forecasts of streamflow categories were obtained for some of the years forecast independently. The scheme's operational utility is thus demonstrated. albeit over short lead-times. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {A technique for producing regional rainfall forecasts for southern Africa is developed that statistically maps or "recalibrates'' large-scale circulation features produced by the ECHAM3.6 general circulation model (GCM) to observed regional rainfall for the December-February (DJF) season. The recalibration technique, model output statistics (MOS), relates archived records of GCM fields to observed DJF rainfall through a set of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) equations. After screening several potential predictor fields, the 850-hPa geopotential height field is selected as the single predictor field in the CCA equations that is subsequently used to produce MOS-recalibrated rainfall patterns. The recalibrated forecasts outscore area-averaged GCM-simulated rainfall anomalies, as well as forecasts produced using a simple linear forecast model. The MOS recalibration is applied to two sets of GCM experiments: for the "simulation'' experiment, simultaneous observed sea surface temperature (SST) serves as the lower boundary forcing; for the "hindcast'' experiment, the prescribed SSTs are obtained by persisting the previous month's SST anomaly through the forecast period. Pattern analyses performed on the predictor-predictand pairs confirm a robust relationship between the GCM 850-hPa height fields and the rainfall fields. The structure and variability of the large- scale circulation is well characterized by the GCM in both simulation and hindcast mode. Measures of retroactive skill for a 9-yr independent period (1991/92-1999/2000) using the hindcast MOS are obtained for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts, suggesting that a probabilistic representation of MOS forecasts is potentially more valuable. Finally, MOS is employed to investigate its potential to downscale the GCM large-scale circulation to more specific forecasts of land surface characteristics such as streamflow.},

Extreme value analysis was performed by fitting the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution using L moment and maximum likelihood estimators. The comparison does not appear to be sensitive to which statistical method of the estimation of parameters of the GEV distribution is used, although individual return values are influenced by the choice of method. The skill of both GCMs in reproducing extreme high and low temperatures is limited, and statistical downscaling from GCMs tends to improve their performance, although it generally yields extremes that are too moderate compared to observed values (this holds for downscaling both from observations and GCMs). White noise addition in downscaling from observations leads to more realistic return values of annual maximum and minimum temperatures than variance inflation.},

	abstract = {Under the effect of climate change, warming likely means that there will be more water vapour in the atmosphere and extreme storms are expected to occur more frequently and with greater severity, resulting in municipal Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with higher intensities and shorter return periods. A regional climate model, MM5 (the Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric Research numerical model), was set up in a one-way, three-domain nested framework to simulate future summer (May to August) precipitation of central Alberta. MM5 is forced with climate data of four Global Climate Models, CGCM3, ECHAM5, CCSM3, and MIROC3.2, for the baseline 1971–2000 and 2011–2100 based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2, A1B, and B1 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Due to the bias of MM5’s simulations, a quantile-quantile bias correction method and a regional frequency analysis is applied to derive projected grid-based IDF curves for central Alberta. In addition, future trends of air temperature and precipitable water, which affect storm pattern and intensity, are investigated. Future IDF curves show a wide range of increased intensities especially for storms of short durations (≤1-h). Conversely, future IDF curves are expected to shift upward because of increased air temperature and precipitable water which are projected to be about 2.9 °C and 29 \% in average by 2071–2100, respectively. Our results imply that the impact of climate change could increase the future risk of flooding in central Alberta.},

For severe convective storms (tornadoes, hailstorms, and severe thunderstorms), differences in time and space of practices of collecting reports of events make using the reporting database to detect trends extremely difficult. Overall, changes in the frequency of environments favorable for severe thunderstorms have not been statistically significant. For extreme precipitation, there is strong evidence for a nationally averaged upward trend in the frequency and intensity of events. The causes of the observed trends have not been determined with certainty, although there is evidence that increasing atmospheric water vapor may be one factor. For hurricanes and typhoons, robust detection of trends in Atlantic and western North Pacific tropical cyclone (TC) activity is significantly constrained by data heterogeneity and deficient quantification of internal variability. Attribution of past TC changes is further challenged by a lack of consensus on the physical link- ages between climate forcing and TC activity. As a result, attribution of trends to anthropogenic forcing remains controversial. For severe snowstorms and ice storms, the number of severe regional snowstorms that occurred since 1960 was more than twice that of the preceding 60 years. There are no significant multidecadal trends in the areal percentage of the contiguous United States impacted by extreme seasonal snowfall amounts since 1900. There is no distinguishable trend in the frequency of ice storms for the United States as a whole since 1950.},

Compared to its predecessor CMIP3, the fifth phase of the homonymous experiment—CMIP5 involves a greater number of GCMs, run at higher resolutions with more complex components. Here we use daily GCM data from both projects to test their efficiency in representing precipitation and temperature parameters with the use of a state of the art high resolution gridded global dataset for land areas and for the period 1960–2005. Two simple metrics, a comprehensive histogram similarity metric based on the match of simulated and observed empirical pdfs and a metric for the representation of the annual cycle were employed as performance indicators. The metrics were used to assess the skill of each GCM at the entire spectrum of precipitation and temperature pdfs but also for the upper and lower tails of it. Results are presented globally and regionally for 26 land regions that represent different climatic regimes, covering the total earth’s land surface except for Antarctica. Compared to CMIP3, CMIP5 models perform better in simulating precipitation including relatively intense events and the fraction of wet days. For temperature the improvement is not as clear except for the upper and lower hot and cold events of the distribution. The agreement of model simulations is also considerably increased in CMIP5. Substantial improvement in intense precipitation is observed over North Europe, Central and Eastern North America and North East Europe. Nevertheless, in both ensembles some models clearly perform better than others from a histogram similarity point of view. The derived skill score metrics provide essential information for impact studies based on global or regional land area multi-model ensembles.},

	abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal-for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate "good'' and "bad'' models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models.},

Results indicate that there have been statistically significant, spatially coherent trends in temperature indices that are related to temperature increases in the region. Significant, increasing trends have been found in the annual maximum of daily maximum and minimum temperature, the annual minimum of daily maximum and minimum temperature, the number of summer nights, and the number of days where daily temperature has exceeded its 90th percentile. Significant negative trends have been found in the number of days when daily temperature is below its 10th percentile and daily temperature range. Trends in precipitation indices, including the number of days with precipitation, the average precipitation intensity, and maximum daily precipitation events, are weak in general and do not show spatial coherence.

	abstract = {AbstractThe impact of climate change on the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is studied using a fully coupled climate model. The model results show that the PDO has a similar spatial pattern in altered climates, but its amplitude and time scale of variability change in response to global warming or cooling. In response to global warming the PDO amplitude is significantly reduced, with a maximum decrease over the Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension (KOE) region. This reduction appears to be associated with a weakened meridional temperature gradient in the KOE region. In addition, reduced variability of North Pacific wind stress, partially due to reduced air–sea feedback, also helps to weaken the PDO amplitude by reducing the meridional displacements of the subtropical and subpolar gyre boundaries. In contrast, the PDO amplitude increases in response to global cooling.In the control simulations the model PDO has an approximately bidecadal peak. In a warmer climate the PDO time scale becomes shorter, changing from {\textasciitilde}20 to {\textasciitilde}12 yr. In a colder climate the time scale of the PDO increases to {\textasciitilde}34 yr. Physically, global warming (cooling) enhances (weakens) ocean stratification. The increased (decreased) ocean stratification acts to increase (reduce) the phase speed of internal Rossby waves, thereby altering the time scale of the simulated PDO.},

	abstract = {The interannual and decadal variability of summer (June to September) air temperature in the northeastern Mediterranean is analysed for the period 1950 to 1999. Extremely hot and cool summers are illustrated by means of composite analysis. The combined influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and thermic predictors on local temperature is assessed by means of an objective approach based on empirical orthogonal functions and canonical correlation analysis. Monthly values of sea level pressure, geopotential heights, atmospheric thickness and Mediterranean sea surface temperatures are used as predictor fields and air temperature from 24 observational sites spread over Greece and western Turkey constitute the predictand variable. Results indicate that more than 50\% of the total summer temperature variability can be explained linearly by the combination of eight large-scale predictor fields on two canonical correlation modes. The first canonical mode is related to a more meridional circulation at the upper tropospheric levels, which favours local land-sea contrasts in the associated local temperature pattern. Variations of this mode are found to be responsible for the occurrence of extreme events and decadal trends in regional temperature, the latter being characterized by a cooling in the early 1960s and a warming in the early 1990s. The second canonical mode pictures variations in the intensity of the zonal circulation over the Atlantic area that drive temperature anomalies affecting mainly the Aegean Sea and the west of Greece. Our results suggest the potential of statistical downscaling for Greek summer temperature with reliable climate forecasts for planetary-scale anomalies.},

Our analyses assess the ability of CMIP5 models to capture observed trends, and we also evaluate the projected future changes in extreme events over the contiguous Unites States. Consistent with the previous articles, here we focus on model-simulated historical trends and projections for temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, large-scale drivers of precipitation variability and drought, and extratropical storms. Comparing new CMIP5 model results with earlier CMIP3 simulations shows that in general CMIP5 simulations give similar patterns and magnitudes of future temperature and precipitation extremes in the United States relative to the projections from the earlier phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) models. Specifically, projections presented here show significant changes in hot and cold temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, droughts, atmospheric patterns such as the North American monsoon and the North Atlantic subtropical high that affect interannual precipitation, and in extratropical storms over the twenty-first century. Most of these trends are consistent with, although in some cases (such as heavy precipitation) underestimate, observed trends.},

	abstract = {We explore a strategy for long-range hydrologic forecasting that uses ensemble climate model forecasts as input to a macroscale hydrologic model to produce runoff and streamflow forecasts at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for water management. Monthly ensemble climate model forecasts produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/Climate Prediction Center global spectral model (GSM) are bias corrected, downscaled to 1/8degrees horizontal resolution, and disaggregated to a daily time step for input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model. Bias correction is effected by evaluating the GSM ensemble forecast variables as percentiles relative to the GSM model climatology and then extracting the percentiles' associated variable values instead from the observed climatology. The monthly meteorological forecasts are then interpolated to the finer hydrologic model scale, at which a daily signal that preserves the forecast anomaly is imposed through resampling of the historic record. With the resulting monthly runoff and streamflow forecasts for the East Coast and Ohio River basin, we evaluate the bias correction and resampling approaches during the southeastern United States drought from May to August 2000 and also for the El Nino conditions of December 1997 to February 1998. For the summer 2000 study period, persistence in anomalous initial hydrologic states predominates in determining the hydrologic forecasts. In contrast, the El Nino-condition hydrologic forecasts derive direction both from the climate model forecast signal and the antecedent land surface state. From a qualitative standpoint the hydrologic forecasting strategy appears successful in translating climate forecast signals to hydrologic variables of interest for water management.},

	abstract = {Numerous recent studies have shown that existing water supply systems are sensitive to climate change. One apparent implication is that water resources planning methods should be modified accordingly. Few of these studies, however, have attempted to account for either the chain of uncertainty in projecting water resources system vulnerability to climate change, or the adaptability of system operation resulting from existing planning strategies. Major uncertainties in water resources climate change assessments lie in a) climate modeling skill; b) errors in regional downscaling of climate model predictions; and c) uncertainties in future water demands. A simulation study was designed to provide insight into some aspects of these uncertainties. Specifically, the question that is addressed is whether a different decision would be made in a reservoir reallocation decision if knowledge about future climate were incorporated (i.e., would planning based on climate change information be justified?). The case study is possible reallocation of flood storage to conservation (municipal water supply) on the Green River, WA. We conclude that, for the case study, reservoir reallocation decisions and system performance would not differ significantly if climate change information were incorporated in the planning process.},

A total of 14 re-analysis-driven RCM experiments covering the period 1961–2000 and 10 GCM-driven transient climate change projections for 1950–2099 are analysed. A positive springtime SAF is found in all RCMs, but the range of the diagnosed SAF is large. Results are compared against an observation-based SAF estimate. For some RCMs, values very close to this estimate are found; other models show a considerable overestimation of the SAF. Net shortwave radiation has the largest influence of all components of the energy balance on the diagnosed SAF and can partly explain its spatial variability. Model deficiencies in reproducing 2m temperatures above snow and ice and associated cold temperature biases at high elevations seem to contribute to a SAF overestimation in several RCMs. The diagnosed SAF in the observational period strongly influences the estimated SAF contribution to twenty first century temperature changes in the European Alps. This contribution is subject to a clear elevation dependency that is governed by the elevation-dependent change in the number of snow days. Elevations of maximum SAF contribution range from 1500 to 2000 m in spring and are found above 2000 m in summer. Here, a SAF contribution to the total simulated temperature change between 0 and 0.5 °C until 2099 (multi-model mean in spring: 0.26 °C) or 0 and 14 \% (multi-model mean in spring: 8 \%) is obtained for models showing a realistic SAF. These numbers represent a well-funded but only approximate estimate of the SAF contribution to future warming, and a remaining contribution of model-specific SAF misrepresentations cannot be ruled out.},

Over the 80-yr runs, the models produce a mean SAF at the surface of 0.3 W m−2 K−1 with a standard deviation of 0.09 W m−2 K−1. Relative to 2 × CO2 equilibrium run estimates from an earlier group of models, both the mean SAF and the standard deviation are reduced. Three-quarters of the model mean SAF comes from the Northern Hemisphere in roughly equal parts from the land and ocean areas. The remainder is due to Southern Hemisphere ocean areas. The SAF differences between the models are shown to stem mainly from the sensitivity of the surface albedo to surface temperature rather from the impact of a given surface albedo change on the shortwave budget.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Empirical transfer functions have been proposed as a means for ''downscaling'' simulations from general circulation models (GCMs) to the local scale. However, subjective decisions made during the development of these functions may influence the ensuing climate scenarios. This research evaluated the sensitivity of a selected empirical transfer function methodology to 1) the definition of the seasons for which separate specification equations are derived, 2) adjustments for known departures of the GCM simulations of the predictor variables from observations, 3) the length of the calibration period, 4) the choice of function form, and 5) the choice of predictor variables. A modified version of the Climatological Projection by Model Statistics method was employed to generate control (1 X CO3 and perturbed (2 X CO2) scenarios of daily maximum and minimum temperature for two locations with diverse climates (Alcantarilla, Spain, and Eau Claire, Michigan). The GCM simulations used in the scenario development were from the Canadian Climate Centre second-generation model (CCC GCMII). Variations in the downscaling methodology were found to have a statistically significant impact on the 2 X CO2 climate scenarios, even though the 1 X CO2 scenarios for the different transfer function approaches were often similar. The daily temperature scenarios for Alcantarilla and Eau Claire were most sensitive to the decision to adjust for deficiencies in the GCM simulations, the choice of predictor variables, and the seasonal definitions used to derive the functions (i.e., fixed seasons, floating seasons, or no seasons). The scenarios were less sensitive to the choice of function form (i.e., linear versus nonlinear) and to an increase in the length of the calibration period. The results of Part I, which identified significant departures of the CCC GCMII simulations of two candidate predictor variables from observations, together with those presented here in Part II, 1) illustrate the importance of detailed comparisons of observed and GCM 1 X CO2 series of candidate predictor variables as an initial step in impact analysis, 2) demonstrate that decisions made when developing the transfer functions can have a substantial influence on the 2 X CO2 scenarios and their interpretation, 3) highlight the uncertainty in the appropriate criteria for evaluating transfer function approaches, and 4) suggest that automation of empirical transfer function methodologies is inappropriate because of differences in the performance of transfer functions between sites and because of spatial differences in the GCM's ability to adequately simulate the predictor variables used in the functions.},

Projected climate change may have a profound impact on this highly climate sensitive activity, which owes its existence to the moderating influence of the Great Lakes. Downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature series provided by the U.S. National Assessment were utilized to evaluate 1) possible changes in the frequency and timing of several agronomically-relevant temperature threshold events and 2) potential interactions between crop phenology and a commercially-important insect pest (Cydia pornonella (L.)). The analyses are for the two future decades of 2025 to 2034 and 2090 to 2099. The assessments for 2025 to 2034 suggest that fruit-growing areas in the Great Lakes region will experience a moderate increase in growing season length and seasonal heat accumulation and a decrease in the frequency of freezing temperatures. In addition, important growth stages will occur earlier in the calendar year than at present. Very large changes in the temperature threshold parameters are projected for 2090 to 2099. However, it is unclear for both assessment decades whether fruit production will be more or less susceptible to damage from cold temperatures after critical growth stages are reached. Projected warming may also result in increases in the number of generations per season of a primary insect pest and the number of necessary pesticide applications.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the historical development of statistical weather models, from simple analyses of runs of consecutive rainy and dry days at single sites, through to multisite models of daily precipitation. Weather generators have been used extensively in water engineering design and in agricultural, ecosystem and hydrological impact studies as a means of in- filling missing data or for producing indefinitely long synthetic weather series from finite station records. We begin by describing the statistical properties of the rainfall occurrence and amount processes which are necessary precursors to the simulation of other (dependent) meteorological variables. The relationship between these daily weather models and lower-frequency variations in climate statistics is considered next, noting that conventional weather generator techniques often fail to capture wholly interannual variability Possible solutions to this deficiency - such as the use of mixtures of slowly and rapidly varying conditioning variables are discussed. Common applications of weather generators are then described. These include the modelling of climate- sensitive systems, the simulation of missing weather data and statistical downscaling of regional climate change scenarios. Finally, we conclude by considering ongoing advances in the simulation of spatially correlated weather series at multiple sites, the downscaling of interannual climate variability and the scope for using nonparametric techniques to synthesize weather series.},

A simple stochastic precipitation model is used to downscale-i.e. disaggregate from area-average to individual station- precipitation statistics for 6 groups of 5 U.S. stations, in a way that is consistent with observed relationships between the area-averaged series and their constituent station series. Each group of stations is located within a General Circulation Model grid-box-sized area, and collectively they exhibit a broad range of precipitation climates. The downscaling procedure is validated using natural climate variability in the observed precipitation records as an analog for climate change, by alternately considering collections of the driest and wettest seasons as 'base' and 'future' climates, and comparing the 2 sets of downscaled station parameters to those fit directly to the respective withheld observations. The resulting downscaled stochastic model parameters can be readily used for local-scale simulation of climate-change impacts.},

Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase flood risk through more frequent heavy precipitation, increased catchment wetness and sea level rise. This paper reviews steps being taken by actors at international, national, regional and community levels to adapt to flood risk from tidal, fluvial, surface and groundwater sources. We refer to existing inventories, national and sectoral adaptation plans, flood inquiries, building and planning codes, city plans, research literature and international policy reviews. We distinguish between the enabling environment for adaptation and specific implementing measures to manage flood risk. Enabling includes routine monitoring, flood forecasting, data exchange, institutional reform, bridging organizations, contingency planning for disasters, insurance and legal incentives to reduce vulnerability. All such activities are ‘low regret’ in that they yield benefits regardless of the climate scenario but are not cost-free. Implementing includes climate safety factors for new build, upgrading resistance and resilience of existing infrastructure, modifying operating rules, development control, flood forecasting, temporary and permanent retreat from hazardous areas, periodic review and adaptive management. We identify evidence of both types of adaptation following the catastrophic 2010/11 flooding in Victoria, Australia. However, significant challenges remain for managing transboundary flood risk (at all scales), protecting existing property at risk from flooding, and ensuring equitable outcomes in terms of risk reduction for all. Adaptive management also raises questions about the wider preparedness of society to systematically monitor and respond to evolving flood risks and vulnerabilities.},

The GCM used was the U.K. Meteorological Office, Hadley Centre's coupled ocean/atmosphere model (HadCM2) forced by combined CO, and sulfate aerosol changes. Climate model results for 1980-1999 (present) and 2080-2099 (future) were used, for six regions across the United States. The downscaling methods compared were different weather generator techniques (the standard "WGEN" method, and a method based on spell-length durations), two different methods using grid point vorticity data as an atmospheric predictor variable (B-Circ and C-Circ), and two variations of an artificial neural network (ANN) transfer function technique using circulation data and circulation plus temperature data as predictor variables. Comparisons of results were facilitated by using standard sets of observed and GCM-derived predictor variables and by using a standard suite of diagnostic statistics. Significant differences in the level of skill were found among the downscaling methods. The weather generation techniques, which are able to fit a number of daily precipitation statistics exactly, yielded the smallest differences between observed and simulated daily precipitation. The ANN methods performed poorly because of a failure to simulate wet-day occurrence statistics adequately. Changes in precipitation between the present and future scenarios produced by the statistical downscaling methods were generally smaller than those produced directly by the GCM. Changes in daily precipitation produced by the GCM between 1980-1999 and 2080-2099 were therefore judged not to be due primarily to changes in atmospheric circulation. In the light of these results and detailed model comparisons, suggestions for future research and model refinements are presented.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Because of the coarse resolution of general circulation models (GCM), 'downscaling' techniques have emerged as a means of relating meso-scale atmospheric variables to grid- and sub- grid-scale surface variables. This study investigates these relationships. As a precursor, inter-variable correlations were investigated within a suite of 15 potential downscaling predictor variables on a daily time-scale for six regions in the conterminous USA, and observed correlations were compared with those based on the HadCM2 coupled ocean/atmosphere GCM. A comparison was then made of observed and model correlations between daily precipitation occurrence (a time series of zeroes and ones) and wet-day amounts and the 15 predictors. These two analyses provided new insights into model performance and provide results that are central to the choice of predictor variables in downscaling of daily precipitation. Also determined were the spatial character of relationships between observed daily precipitation and both mean sea-level pressure (mslp) and atmospheric moisture and daily precipitation for selected regions. The question of whether the same relationships are replicated by HadCM2 was also examined. This allowed the assessment of the spatial consistency of key predictor-predictand relationships in observed and HadCM2 data. Finally, the temporal stability of these relationships in the GCM was examined. Little difference between results for 1980- 1999 and 2080-2099 was observed. For correlations between predictor variables, observed and model results were generally similar, providing strong evidence of the overall physical realism of the model. For correlations with precipitation, the results are less satisfactory. For example, model precipitation is more strongly dependent on surface divergence and specific humidity than observed precipitation, while the latter has a stronger link to 500 hPa divergence than is evident in the model. These results suggest possible deficiencies in the model precipitation process, and may indicate that the model overestimates future changes in precipitation. Correlation field patterns for mslp versus precipitation are remarkably similar for observed data and HadCM2 output. Differences in the correlation fields for specific humidity are more noticeable, especially in summer. in many cases, maximum correlations between precipitation and mslp occurred away from the grid box; whereas correlations with specific humidity were largest when the data were propinquitous. This suggests that the choice of predictor variable and the corresponding predictor domain, in terms of location and spatial extent, are critical factors affecting the realism and stability of downscaled precipitation scenarios.

	volume = {225},
	abstract = {The fundamental rationale for statistical downscaling is that the raw outputs of climate change experiments from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are an inadequate basis for assessing the effects of climate change on land-surface processes at regional scales. This is because the spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to resolve important sub-grid scale processes (most notably those pertaining to the hydrological cycle) and because GCM output is often unreliable at individual and sub- grid box scales. By establishing empirical relationships between grid-box scale circulation indices (such as atmospheric vorticity and divergence) and sub-grid scale surface predictands (such as precipitation), statistical downscaling has been proposed as a practical means of bridging this spatial difference. This study compared three sets of current and future rainfall-runoff scenarios. The scenarios were constructed using: (1) statistically downscaled GCM output; (2) raw GCM output; and (3) raw GCM output corrected for elevational biases. Atmospheric circulation indices and humidity variables were extracted from the output of the UK Meteorological Office coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM (HadCM2) in order to downscale daily precipitation and temperature series for the Animas River in the San Juan River basin, Colorado. Significant differences arose between the modelled snowpack and how regimes of the three future climate scenarios. Overall, the raw GCM output suggests larger reductions in winter/spring snowpack and summer runoff than the downscaling, relative to current conditions. Further research is required to determine the generality of the water resource implications for other regions, GCM outputs and downscaled scenarios. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The lack of change in downscaled surface variables between the 1980-1999 and 2080-2099 data was attributed to the low sensitivity of atmospheric circulation patterns in HadCM2SUL to greenhouse gas forcing.

	title = {Statistical downscaling of daily precipitation using daily airflow and seasonal teleconnection indices},
	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Monthly or seasonal climate variability is seldom captured adequately by high-resolution statistical downscaling models. However, such deficiences may, in fact, be an artefact of the failure of many downscaling models to incorporate appropriate low-frequency predictor variables. The present study explores the possibility of using variables that characterise both the high- and low-frequency variability of daily precipitation at selected sites in the British Isles. Accordingly, 3 statistical downscaling models were calibrated by regressing daily precipitation data for sites at Durham and Kempsford, UK, against regional climate predictors for the period 1881-1935. Model 1 employed only 1 predictor, the daily vorticity obtained from daily grid-point mean-sea-level pressure over the British Isles. Model 2 employed both daily vorticity and seasonal North Atlantic Oscillation Indices (NAOI) as predictors. Finally, Model 3 employed daily vorticity and seasonal North Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies as predictors. All 3 models were validated using daily and monthly precipitation statistics at the same stations for the period 1936-1990. Although Models 2 and 3 did yield improvements in the downscaling of the monthly precipitation diagnostics, the enhancement was only modest relative to Model 1 (the vorticity- only model). Nonetheless, the preliminary results suggest that there may be some merit in using North Atlantic SST series as a downscaling predictor variable for daily/monthly precipitation in the UK. However, further research is required to determine whether or not the inclusion of teleconnection indices in downscaling schemes leads to better representations of low- frequency variability in both present and future climates when General Circulation Model outputs are employed.},

	volume = {213},
	abstract = {Low-frequency, high-magnitude daily rainfall amounts recorded at several sites in central and southern England were related to the prevailing Lamb Weather Types (LWTs), daily weather front and airflow data. Three statistically distinct weather- type clusters were indentified and used to construct a simplified frontal model of daily precipitation occurrence/amount. The model was calibrated against station data for the period 1970-1990 and used to reconstruct observed daily precipitation between 1875 and 1969 given the historic sequence of LWTs. Although the model reproduced the incidence of low-frequency, high-magnitude events, it failed to capture variations in mean wet day probabilities and wet/dry spell persistence. This inability was attributed to the general limitations of the weather classification methodology, which did not capture all aspects of the precipitation regime with equal levels of proficiency. Therefore, the prospects for downscaling high-resolution precipitation series directly from indices of mean sea-lever pressure rather than via weather patterns was discussed. Preliminary results indicate that relationships can be established between mean daily precipitation occurrence and airflow indices such as vorticity and strength of air how. However, further research is required to establish the value of such indices for modelling low- frequency, high-magnitude precipitation events. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {This study investigates whether GCM-simulated precipitation is a good predictor for regional precipitation over Washington and Oregon. In order to allow for a detailed comparison of the estimated precipitation with observations, the simulated precipitation is taken from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which nearly perfectly represents the historic pressure, temperature, and humidity, but calculates precipitation according to the model physics and parameterizations. Three statistical downscaling methods are investigated: (i) local rescaling of the simulated precipitation, and two newly developed methods, namely, (ii) downscaling using singular value decomposition (SVD) with simulated precipitation as the predictor, and (iii) local rescaling with a dynamical correction. Both local scaling methods are straightforward to apply to GCMs that are used for climate change experiments and seasonal forecasts, since they only need control runs for model fitting. The SVD method requires for model fitting special reanalysis-type GCM runs nudged toward observations from a historical period (selection of analogs from the GCM chosen to optimally match the historical weather states might achieve similar results). The precipitation-based methods are compared with conventional statistical downscaling using SVD with various large-scale predictors such as geopotential height, temperature, and humidity. The skill of the different methods for reconstructing historical wintertime precipitation (1958-94) over Oregon and Washington is tested on various spatial scales as small as 50 km and on temporal scales from months to decades. All methods using precipitation as a predictor perform considerably better than the conventional downscaling. The best results using conventional methods are obtained with geopotential height at 1000 hPa or humidity at 850 hPa as predictors. In these cases correlations of monthly observed and reconstructed precipitation on the 50-km scale range from 0.43 to 0.65. The inclusion of several predictor fields does not improve the reconstructions, since they are all highly correlated. Local rescaling of simulated precipitation yields much higher correlations between 0.7 and 0.9, with the exception of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains in the Columbia Basin (eastern Washington). When the simulated precipitation is used as a predictor in SVD-based downscaling correlations also reach 0.7 in eastern Washington. Dynamical correction improves the local scaling considerably in the rain shadow and yields correlations almost as high as with the SVD method. Its combination of high skill and ease to use make it particularly attractive for GCM precipitation downscaling.},

	abstract = {An analysis of detailed relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation-Arctic Oscillation (NAO-AO) and local temperature response throughout the northeastern United States and neighboring areas of Canada is presented. In particular, the study focuses on how contrasts in the mean and daily variance, based on AO phase, are associated with contrasts in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events in both winter and spring. In this region, notable contrasts in mean temperatures in winter and daily variance in spring, which influence the pattern of extremes, are associated with phases of the NAO-AO. Warmer temperatures in New England and cooler temperatures in Quebec, Canada, result during winter with increases in the NAO-AO index. The mean temperature response is weaker in spring, but the response of daily variance of temperature is stronger; variance increases with the NAO-AO index. Relationships between these effects help explain significant increases in maximum temperature extremes during winter in New England and in minimum temperature extremes during spring in Quebec for high NAO-AO index years. Diurnal temperature range tends to be larger in AO-positive winters and springs throughout the region. This study helps put other work on the trends in regional extreme events into the context of large-scale climate variability.},

	abstract = {Using the results obtained from a coupled ocean-atmosphere-land model with medium computational resolution, we investigated how the hydrology of the continents changes in response to the combined increases of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which are determined based upon the IS92a scenario. In order to extract the forced response from natural, internal variability, the difference between the mean of an eight-member ensemble of numerical experiments and a control experiment are used for the present analysis. The global mean surface air temperature of the coupled model increases by about 2.3°C above the preindustrial level by the middle of the 21st century. Accompanying the warming, the global mean rates of both precipitation and evaporation increase by 5.2\%, yielding the average increase in the rate of runoff by approximately 7.3\%. The increase in the rate of runoff simulated by the model is particularly large in high northern latitudes, where the runoff from some rivers such as the Mackenzie and Ob\&\#8242; may increase by as much as 20\%. Runoff from many European rivers increases by more than 20\%. Runoff also increases substantially in some tropical rivers such as the Amazon and Ganges. However, the percentage changes in simulated runoff from many other tropical rivers and middle latitude rivers are smaller with both positive and negative signs. In middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, soil moisture tends to decrease in summer, whereas it increases in winter. However, in many semi-arid regions in subtropical and middle latitudes, soil moisture is reduced during most of a year. These semi-arid regions include the southwestern part of North America, the northeastern part of China in the Northern Hemisphere, and the region in the vicinity of the Kalahari Desert and southern part of Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. Since a semi-arid region usually surrounds a desert, the reduction of soil moisture in such a region often results in the expansion of the desert. Soil moisture is also reduced during the dry season in many semi-arid regions. For example, it is reduced in the savannahs of Africa and South America during winter and early spring in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is reduced at the Mediterranean coast of Europe in summer.},

	abstract = {This paper examines hydrological variability and its changes in two different versions of a coupled ocean\&\#8211;atmosphere general circulation model developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and forced with estimates of future increases of greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations. This paper is the second part, documenting potential changes in variability as greenhouse gases increase. The variance changes are examined using an ensemble of 8 transient integrations for an older model version and 10 transient integrations for a newer model. Monthly and annual data are used to compute the mean and variance changes. Emphasis is placed on computing and analyzing the variance changes for the middle of the twenty-first century and compared with those found in the respective control integrations.The hydrologic cycle intensifies because of the increase of greenhouse gases. In general, precipitation variance increases in most places. This is the case virtually everywhere the mean precipitation rate increases and many places where the precipitation decreases. The precipitation rate variance decreases in the subtropics, where the mean precipitation rate also decreases. The increased precipitation rate and variance, in middle to higher latitudes during late fall, winter, and early spring leads to increased runoff and its variance during that period.On the other hand, the variance changes of soil moisture are more complicated, because soil moisture has both a lower and upper bound that tends to reduce its fluctuations. This is particularly true in middle to higher latitudes during winter and spring, when the soil moisture is close to its saturation value at many locations. Therefore, changes in its variance are limited. Soil moisture variance change is positive during the summer, when the mean soil moisture decreases and is close to the middle of its allowable range. In middle to high northern latitudes, an increase in runoff and its variance during late winter and spring plus the decrease in soil moisture and its variance during summer lend support to the hypothesis stated in other publications that a warmer climate can cause an increasing frequency of both excessive discharge and drier events, depending on season and latitude.},

	doi = {10.1175/2010jcli3594.1},
	abstract = {Multimodel combination is a pragmatic approach to estimating model uncertainties and to making climate projections more reliable. The simplest way of constructing a multimodel is to give one vote to each model ("equal weighting"), while more sophisticated approaches suggest applying model weights according to some measure of performance ("optimum weighting"). In this study, a simple conceptual model of climate change projections is introduced and applied to discuss the effects of model weighting in more generic terms. The results confirm that equally weighted multimodels on average outperform the single models, and that projection errors can in principle be further reduced by optimum weighting. However, this not only requires accurate knowledge of the single model skill, but the relative contributions of the joint model error and unpredictable noise also need to be known to avoid biased weights. If weights are applied that do not appropriately represent the true underlying uncertainties, weighted multimodels perform on average worse than equally weighted ones, which is a scenario that is not unlikely, given that at present there is no consensus on how skill-based weights can be obtained. Particularly when internal variability is large, more information may be lost by inappropriate weighting than could potentially be gained by optimum weighting. These results indicate that for many applications equal weighting may be the safer and more transparent way to combine models. However, also within the presented framework eliminating models from an ensemble can be justified if they are known to lack key mechanisms that are indispensable for meaningful climate projections.},

Being without much sophistication, both models show acceptable performance on this time scale only for TAV and HPR; PRC, which behaves in a predominantly nonlinear fashion, handled very poorly. By considerably refining the evaluation it is nevertheless possible to distinguish significant differences between the 2 models and, with the nonlinear model, to describe specific rainfall conditions.

With climate impact assessment in mind, we test the accuracy of the seasonal averages of temperature, precipitation, and mean sea level pressure, compared to two observational datasets. Nondimensional skill scores have been generated for the global land and six continental domains. For most cases the 25 models analyzed perform well, particularly the models from Europe. Overall, this CMIP5 ensemble shows improved skill over the earlier (ca. 2005) CMIP3 ensemble of 24 models. This improvement is seen for each variable and continent, and in each case it is largely consistent with the increased resolution on average of CMIP5, given the correlation between scores and grid length found across the combined ensemble. From this apparent influence on skill, the smaller average score for the 13 Earth system models in CMIP5 is consistent with their mostly lower resolution. There is some variation in the ranking of models by skill score for the global, versus continental, measures of skill, and this prompts consideration of the potential influence of a regional focus that model developers might have. While some models rank considerably better in their ?home? continent than globally, most have similar ranks in the two domains. Averaging over each ensemble, the home rank is better by only one or two ranks, indicating that the location of development is only a minor influence.},

	abstract = {Bias-correction methods applied to monthly temperature and precipitation data simulated by multiple General Circulation Models (GCMs) are evaluated in this study. Although various methods have been proposed recently, an intercomparison among them using multiple GCM simulations has seldom been reported. Moreover, no previous methods have addressed the issue how to adequately deal with the changes of the statistics of bias-corrected variables from the historical to future simulations. In this study, a new method which conserves the changes of mean and standard deviation of the uncorrected model simulation data is proposed, and then five previous bias-correction methods as well as the proposed new method are intercompared by applying them to monthly temperature and precipitation data simulated from 12 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archives. Parameters of each method are calibrated by using 1948\&\#8211;1972 observed data and validated in the 1974\&\#8211;1998 period. These methods are then applied to the GCM future simulations (2073\&\#8211;2097) and the bias-corrected data are intercompared. For the historical simulations, negligible difference can be found between observed and bias-corrected data. However, the differences in future simulations are large dependent on the characteristics of each method. The new method successfully conserves the changes in the mean, standard deviation and the coefficient of variation before and after bias-correction.

	abstract = {AbstractIn this study (Part I), the mid-twenty-first-century surface air temperature increase in the entire CMIP5 ensemble is downscaled to very high resolution (2 km) over the Los Angeles region, using a new hybrid dynamical?statistical technique. This technique combines the ability of dynamical downscaling to capture finescale dynamics with the computational savings of a statistical model to downscale multiple GCMs. First, dynamical downscaling is applied to five GCMs. Guided by an understanding of the underlying local dynamics, a simple statistical model is built relating the GCM input and the dynamically downscaled output. This statistical model is used to approximate the warming patterns of the remaining GCMs, as if they had been dynamically downscaled. The full 32-member ensemble allows for robust estimates of the most likely warming and uncertainty resulting from intermodel differences. The warming averaged over the region has an ensemble mean of 2.3°C, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 1.0° to 3.6°C. Inland and high elevation areas warm more than coastal areas year round, and by as much as 60\% in the summer months. A comparison to other common statistical downscaling techniques shows that the hybrid method produces similar regional-mean warming outcomes but demonstrates considerable improvement in capturing the spatial details. Additionally, this hybrid technique incorporates an understanding of the physical mechanisms shaping the region?s warming patterns, enhancing the credibility of the final results.},

The PCM executes on several distributed and shared memory computer systems. The coupling method is similar to that used in the NCAR Climate System Model (CSM) in that a flux coupler ties the components together, with interpolations between the different grids of the component models. Flute adjustments are not used in the PCM. The ocean component has 2/3 degrees average horizontal grid spacing with 32 vertical levels and a free surface that allows calculation of sea level changes. Near the equator, the grid spacing is approximately 1/2 degrees in latitude to better capture the ocean equatorial dynamics. The North Pole is rotated over northern North America thus producing resolution smaller than 3/3 degrees in the North Atlantic where the sinking part of the world conveyor circulation largely takes place. Because this ocean model component does not have a computational Feint at the North pole, the Arctic Ocean circulation systems are more realistic and similar to the observed. The elastic viscous plastic sea ice model has a grid spacing of 27 km to represent small-scale features such as ice transport through the Canadian Archipelago and the East Greenland current region. Results from a 300 year present-day coupled climate control simulation are presented, as well as for a transient 1\% per year compound CO2 increase experiment which shows a global warming of 1.27 degreesC for a 10 year average at the doubling point of CO2 and 2.89 degreesC at the quadrupling point. There is a gradual warming beyond the doubling and quadrupling points with CO2 held constant. Globally averaged sea level rise at the time of CO2 control simulation are 1\% per year transient 1\% doubling is approximately 7 cm and at the time of quadrupling it is 23 cm. Some of the regional sea level changes are larger and reflect the adjustments in the temperature, salinity, internal ocean dynamics, surface heat flux, and wind stress on the ocean. A 0.5\% per year CO2 increase experiment also was performed showing a global warming of 1.5 degreesC around the time of CO2 doubling and a similar warming pattern to the 1\% CO2 per year increase experiment. El Nino and La Nina events in the tropical Pacific show approximately the observed frequency distribution and amplitude, which leads to near observed levels of variability on interannual time scales.},

	abstract = {AbstractCalifornia’s Sierra Nevada is a high-elevation mountain range with significant seasonal snow cover. Under anthropogenic climate change, amplification of the warming is expected to occur at elevations near snow margins due to snow albedo feedback. However, climate change projections for the Sierra Nevada made by global climate models (GCMs) and statistical downscaling methods miss this key process. Dynamical downscaling simulates the additional warming due to snow albedo feedback. Ideally, dynamical downscaling would be applied to a large ensemble of 30 or more GCMs to project ensemble-mean outcomes and intermodel spread, but this is far too computationally expensive. To approximate the results that would occur if the entire GCM ensemble were dynamically downscaled, a hybrid dynamical–statistical downscaling approach is used. First, dynamical downscaling is used to reconstruct the historical climate of the 1981–2000 period and then to project the future climate of the 2081–2100 period based on climate changes from five GCMs. Next, a statistical model is built to emulate the dynamically downscaled warming and snow cover changes for any GCM. This statistical model is used to produce warming and snow cover loss projections for all available CMIP5 GCMs. These projections incorporate snow albedo feedback, so they capture the local warming enhancement (up to 3°C) from snow cover loss that other statistical methods miss. Capturing these details may be important for accurately projecting impacts on surface hydrology, water resources, and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {AbstractHigh-resolution gridded datasets are in high demand because they are spatially complete and include important finescale details. Previous assessments have been limited to two to three gridded datasets or analyzed the datasets only at the station locations. Here, eight high-resolution gridded temperature datasets are assessed two ways: at the stations, by comparing with Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily data; and away from the stations, using physical principles. This assessment includes six station-based datasets, one interpolated reanalysis, and one dynamically downscaled reanalysis. California is used as a test domain because of its complex terrain and coastlines, features known to differentiate gridded datasets. As expected, climatologies of station-based datasets agree closely with station data. However, away from stations, spread in climatologies can exceed 6°C. Some station-based datasets are very likely biased near the coast and in complex terrain, due to inaccurate lapse rates. Many station-based datasets have large unphysical trends ({\textgreater}1°C decade−1) due to unhomogenized or missing station data—an issue that has been fixed in some datasets by using homogenization algorithms. Meanwhile, reanalysis-based gridded datasets have systematic biases relative to station data. Dynamically downscaled reanalysis has smaller biases than interpolated reanalysis, and has more realistic variability and trends. Dynamical downscaling also captures snow–albedo feedback, which station-based datasets miss. Overall, these results indicate that 1) gridded dataset choice can be a substantial source of uncertainty, and 2) some datasets are better suited for certain applications.},

Rather than attempting to choose a most likely scenario from the results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an ensemble of climate simulations from five models under three emissions scenarios each was used to drive the basin models.Climate-change scenarios were generated for PRMS by modifying historical precipitation and temperature inputs; mean monthly climate change was derived by calculating changes in mean climates from current to various future decades in the ensemble of climate projections. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were fitted to the PRMS model output driven by the ensemble of climate projections and provided a basis for randomly (but representatively) generating realizations of hydrologic response to future climates. For each realization, the 1.5-yr flood was calculated to represent a flow important for sediment transport and channel geomorphology. The empirical probability density function (pdf) of the 1.5-yr flood was estimated using the results across the realizations for each basin. Of the 14 basins studied, 9 showed clear temporal shifts in the pdfs of the 1.5-yr flood projected into the twenty-first century. In the western United States, where the annual peak discharges are heavily influenced by snowmelt, three basins show at least a 10\% increase in the 1.5-yr flood in the twenty-first century; the remaining two basins demonstrate increases in the 1.5-yr flood, but the temporal shifts in the pdfs and the percent changes are not as distinct. Four basins in the eastern Rockies/central United States show at least a 10\% decrease in the 1.5-yr flood; the remaining two basins demonstrate decreases in the 1.5-yr flood, but the temporal shifts in the pdfs and the percent changes are not as distinct. Two basins in the eastern United States show at least a 10\% decrease in the 1.5-yr flood; the remaining basin shows little or no change in the 1.5-yr flood.},

Root-mean-square errors relative to the 1958\&\#8211;2000 climatology of the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) are summed over the seasonal cycles of three variables: surface air temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure. The specific models that perform best over the larger domains tend to be the ones that perform best over Alaska and Greenland. The rankings of the models are largely unchanged when the bias of each model\&\#8217;s climatological annual mean is removed prior to the error calculation for the individual models. The annual mean biases typically account for about half of the models\&\#8217; root-mean-square errors. However, the root-mean-square errors of the models are generally much larger than the biases of the composite output, indicating that the systematic errors differ considerably among the models. There is a tendency for the models with smaller errors to simulate a larger greenhouse warming over the Arctic, as well as larger increases of Arctic precipitation and decreases of Arctic sea level pressure, when greenhouse gas concentrations are increased. Because several models have substantially smaller systematic errors than the other models, the differences in greenhouse projections imply that the choice of a subset of models may offer a viable approach to narrowing the uncertainty and obtaining more robust estimates of future climate change in regions such as Alaska, Greenland, and the broader Arctic.},

In this paper, we present an efficient and effective Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, entitled the Multiobjective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm, which is capable of solving the multiobjective optimization problem for hydrologic models. MOSCEM is an improvement over the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimization algorithm, using the concept of Pareto dominance (rather than direct single-objective function evaluation) to evolve the initial population of points toward a set of solutions stemming from a stable distribution (Pareto set).

	abstract = {A statistical strategy to deduct regional-scale features from climate general circulation model (GCM) simulations has been designed and tested. The main idea is to interrelate the characteristic patterns of observed simultaneous variations of regional climate parameters and of large-scale atmospheric flow using the canonical correlation technique. The large-scale North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) is related to the regional, variable, winter (DJF) mean Iberian Peninsula rainfall. The skill of the resulting statistical model is shown by reproducing, to a good approximation, the winter mean Iberian rainfall from 1900 to present from the observed North Atlantic mean SLP distributions. It is shown that this observed relationship between these two variables is not well reproduced in the output of a general circulation model (GCM). The implications for Iberian rainfall changes as the response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations simulated by two GCM experiments are examined with the proposed statistical model. In an instantaneous '' 2 CO2'' doubling experiment, using the simulated change of the mean North Atlantic SLP field to predict Iberian rainfall yields, there is an insignificant increase of area-averaged rainfall of 1 mm/month, with maximum values of 4 mm/month in the northwest of the peninsula. In contrast, for the four GCM grid points representing the Iberian Peninsula, the change is - 10 mm/ month, with a minimum of - 19 mm/ month in the southwest. In the second experiment, with the IPCC scenario A (''business as usual'') increase of CO2, the statistical-model results partially differ from the directly simulated rainfall changes: in the experimental range of 100 years, the area-averaged rainfall decreases by 7 mm/month (statistical model), and by 9 mm/month (GCM); at the same time the amplitude of the interdecadal variability is quite different.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of the impact of climate change or climate variability on water resources management requires information at scales much smaller than the current resolution of regional climate models. Subgrid-scale variability of precipitation is typically resolved by running nested or variable resolution models or by statistical downscaling, the latter being especially attractive in ensemble predictions due to its computational efficiency. Most existing precipitation downscaling schemes are based on spatial disaggregation of rainfall patterns, independently at different times, and do not properly account for the temporal persistence of rainfall at the subgrid spatial scales. Such a temporal persistence in rainfall directly relates to the spatial variability of accumulated local soil moisture and might be important if the downscaled values were to be used in a coupled atmospheric- hydrologic model. In this paper we propose a rainfall downscaling model which utilizes the presence of dynamic scaling in rainfall [ Venugopal et al., 1999] and which in conjunction with a spatial disaggregation scheme preserves both the temporal and spatial correlation structure of rainfall at the subgrid scales.},

The present study aims to assess statistical bias correction under nonstationary bias conditions and its implications on the simulated streamflow over two snowmelt-driven Canadian catchments. A pseudoreality approach is employed in order to derive a proxy of future observations. In this approach, CRCM?ECHAM5 ensemble simulations are used as pseudoreality observations to correct for bias in the CRCM?CGCM3 ensemble simulations in the reference (1971?2000) period. The climate model simulations are then bias corrected in the future (2041?70) period and compared with the future pseudoreality observations. This process demonstrates that biases (precipitation and temperature) remain after the bias correction. In a second step, the uncorrected and bias-corrected CRCM?CGCM3 simulations are used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in both periods. The bias correction decreases the error on mean monthly streamflow over the reference period; such findings are more mixed over the future period. The results of various hydrological indicators show that the climate change signal on streamflow obtained with uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is similar in both its magnitude and its direction for the mean monthly streamflow only. Regarding the indicators of extreme hydrological events, more mixed results are found with site dependence. All in all, bias correction under nonstationary bias is an additional source of uncertainty that cannot be neglected in hydrological climate change impact studies.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a general overview of changes in flooding caused by climate change in Finland for the periods 2010-2039 and 2070-2099. Changes in flooding were evaluated at 67 sites in Finland with variable sizes of runoff areas using a conceptual hydrological model and 20 climate scenarios from both global and regional climate models with the delta change approach. Floods with a 100-year return period were estimated with frequency analysis using the Gumbel distribution. At four study sites depicting different watershed types and hydrology, the inundation areas of the 100-year floods were simulated with a 2D hydraulic model. The results demonstrate that the impacts of climate change are not uniform within Finland due to regional differences in climatic conditions and watershed properties. In snowmelt-flood dominated areas, annual floods decreased or remained unchanged due to decreasing snow accumulation. On the other hand, increased precipitation resulted in growing floods in major central lakes and their outflow rivers. The changes in flood inundation did not linearly follow the changes in 100-year discharges, due to varying characteristics of river channels and floodplains. The results highlight the importance of comprehensive climatological and hydrological knowledge and the use of several climate scenarios in estimation of climate change impacts on flooding. Generalisations based on only a few case studies, or large scale flood assessments using only a few climate scenarios should be avoided in countries with variable hydrological conditions.

IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products.},

The temporal evolution of pre-summer drought leads the authors to compute the indices for each year over a defined period according to the climatic normals of each meteorological station and to consider the months inside the dry episode differently, according to the law of emptying the water reserves. As a function of this, standardized drought indices are proposed for the evaluation of the pre-summer drought in tropical zone. Two new indices were tested: one developed from precipitation and the other also considering temperature. These indices were validated by correlation with Advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series and used to identify the most severe drought conditions in the Yucatan Peninsula. The comparison between the indices and their temporal variations highlighted the importance of temperature in the most critical events and left indications of the impact of global warming on the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The southern Mexico and Central America (SMCA) region shows a dominant well-defined precipitation annual cycle. The rainy season usually begins in May and ends in October, with a relatively dry period in July and August known as the mid-summer drought (MSD); notable exceptions are the Caribbean coast of Honduras and Costa Rica. This MSD phenomenon is expected to be affected as the SMCA experiences an enhanced differential warming between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (PO-AO) towards the end of the 21st century. Previous studies have suggested that this differential warming will induce a strengthening of the westward Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) and that this heightened CLLJ will shift precipitation westwards, falling on the PO instead that within the SMCA region causing a severe drought. In this work we examine this scenario with a new model, the Rossby Center Regional Climate Model (RCA4), for the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) Central America domain, forced with different general circulation models (GCMs) and for different representative concentration paths (RCPs). We consider 25-year periods as “present conditions” (1981–2005) and “future scenario” (2071–2095), focusing on the “extended summer” season (May–October). Results suggest that in the future the spatial extension of the MSD will decrease and that in certain areas the MSD will be more intense but less frequent compared to present conditions. Also, the oceanic differential warming, the intensification of the CLLJ, and the reduction in regional precipitation in the future scenario, suggested by previous works, were verified in this study.},

The quantification of errors associated with satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is crucial for a correct use of these datasets in hydrological applications, climate studies, and water resources management. This study presents a review of previous work that focused on validating SPPs for liquid precipitation during the TRMM era through comparisons with surface observations, both in terms of mean errors and detection capabilities across different regions of the world. Several SPPs have been considered: TMPA 3B42 (research and real-time products), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP; both the near-real-time and the Motion Vector Kalman filter products), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN–Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). Topography, seasonality, and climatology were shown to play a role in the SPP’s performance, especially in terms of detection probability and bias. Regions with complex terrain exhibited poor rain detection and magnitude-dependent mean errors; low probability of detection was reported in semiarid areas. Winter seasons, usually associated with lighter rain events, snow, and mixed-phase precipitation, showed larger biases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive inter-comparison between two widely used rainfall datasets – the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the ERA-Interim reanalysis – and the recently released ERA-5, which will replace ERA-Interim as the main European Centre for Medium-Range Weather and Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis by 2020. Systematic and random error components were computed for the reanalysis datasets over the 1979–2018 period using GPCP as reference. The analysis was taken at monthly timescale at 2.5° spatial resolution, limited by GPCP. Despite its resolution limitations and complex algorithms, GPCP has been extensively used for model evaluation due to its global and long-term (over 40 years) coverage. Over most of the tropics, and over localized mid-latitude regions, ERA-5 showed lower bias and unbiased root-mean squared error (ubRMSE), as well as higher correlations, compared to ERA-Interim. Throughout the rest of the globe, these error metrics displayed similar values between both reanalysis, except over localized regions of the eastern tropical Pacific, the Andes and the Himalayas, where ERA-Interim outperformed ERA-5. A process-based analysis revealed that ERA-Interim tended to overestimate deep convection and moisture flux convergence over the tropical oceans and land, leading to excessive rainfall. Similarly, ERA-Interim showed significant rainfall underestimation over the mid-latitude oceans due to underestimation of deep convection and moisture flux convergence. Both cases were significantly improved in ERA-5, likely due to its improved parameterizations and higher resolution. Indeed, the differences in monthly rainfall between the two reanalysis were mainly due to improved dynamical (circulation) rather than thermodynamical (Clausius-Clapeyron) processes or surface evaporation changes. Nonetheless, the results also revealed improved representation of the moisture sink/source patterns over the tropical oceans in ERA-5. Finally, there were significant differences in the long-term rainfall trend patterns amongst the three datasets (with differences reaching {\textasciitilde}30\%/decade), that can extend even to the sign of the trend, with the most notorious differences occurring over tropical Africa. Furthermore, ERA-5 didn’t show improved representation of these trends. In fact, the trend of global-mean rainfall in ERA-Interim was closer to GPCP than ERA-5.},

As a result, drought indices have slowly evolved during the last two centuries from simplistic approaches based on some measure of rainfall deficiency, to more complex problem-specific models. Indices developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century included such measures as percent of normal precipitation over some interval, consecutive days with rain below a given threshold, formulae involving a combination of temperature and precipitation, and models factoring in precipitation deficits over consecutive days. The incorporation of evapotranspiration as a measure of water demand by Thornthwaite led to the landmark development in 1965 by Palmer of a water budget-based drought index that is still widely used. Drought indices developed since the 1960s include the Surface Water Supply Index, which supplements the Palmer Index by integrating snowpack, reservoir storage, streamflow, and precipitation at high elevations; the Keetch–Byram Drought Index, which is used by fire control managers; the Standardized Precipitation Index; and the Vegetation Condition Index, which utilizes global satellite observations of vegetation condition. These models continue to evolve as new data sources become available. The twentieth century concluded with the development of the Drought Monitor tool, which incorporates Palmer's index and several other (post Palmer) indices to provide a universal assessment of drought conditions across the entire United States. By putting the development of these drought indices into a historical perspective, this paper provides a better understanding of the complex Palmer Index and of the nature of measuring drought in general.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a well-reviewed meteorological drought index recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and its more recent climatic water balance variant, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), both rely on selection of a univariate probability distribution to normalize the index, allowing for comparisons across climates. Choice of an improper probability distribution may impart bias to the index values, exaggerating or minimizing drought severity. This study compares a suite of candidate probability distributions for use in SPI and SPEI normalization using the 0.5° × 0.5° gridded Watch Forcing Dataset (WFD) at the continental scale, focusing on Europe. Several modifications to the SPI and SPEI methodology are proposed, as well as an updated procedure for evaluating SPI/SPEI goodness of fit based on the Shapiro–Wilk test. Candidate distributions for SPI organize into two groups based on their ability to model short-term accumulation (1–2 months) or long-term accumulation ({\textgreater}3 months). The two-parameter gamma distribution is recommended for general use when calculating SPI across all accumulation periods and regions within Europe, in agreement with previous studies. The generalized extreme value distribution is recommended when computing the SPEI, in disagreement with previous recommendations.},

	abstract = {We present a reformulation of the Bristow–Campbell model for daily solar radiation, developed using daily observations of radiation, temperature, humidity, and precipitation, from 40 stations in contrasting climates. By expanding the original model to include a spatially and temporally variable estimate of clear-sky transmittance, and applying a small number of other minor modifications, the new model produces better results than the original over a wider range of climates. Our method does not require reparameterization on a site-by-site basis, a distinct advantage over the original approach. We do require observations of dewpoint temperature, which the original model does not, but we suggest a method that could eliminate this dependency. Mean absolute error (MAE) for predictions of clear-sky transmittance was improved by 28\% compared to the original model formulation. Aerosols and snowcover probably contribute to variation in clear-sky transmittance that remains unexplained by our method. MAE and bias for prediction of daily incident radiation were about 2.4MJm−2day−1 and +0.5MJm−2day−1, respectively. As a percent of the average observed values of incident radiation, MAE and bias are about 15\% and +4\%, respectively. The lowest errors and smallest biases (percent basis) occurred during the summer. The highest prediction biases were associated with stations having a strong seasonal concentration of precipitation, with underpredictions at summer-precipitation stations, and overpredictions at winter-precipitation stations. Further study is required to characterize the behavior of this method for tropical climates.},

	abstract = {Minimum daily air temperature (Tn) is often used as a surrogate for mean daily dew point (TI,day) to estimate near-surface humidity. This method is unreliable under arid conditions where nightly minimum temperatures may remain well above the dew point. Daily meteorological data from 52 weather stations within the continental US and Alaska were evaluated. Daily differences between Td,day and Tn were large in arid climates, with corresponding vapor pressure differences averaging between 0.8 and 1.2 kPa on an annual basis. Sites with semi-arid characteristics showed a large degree of seasonality in the results with average vapor pressure differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 kPa between winter and summer months. Sites in other climate regimes generally showed small differences between Tn and Td,day over the entire year, corresponding to average vapor pressure differences of less than 0.3 kPa. An empirical model was developed to improve the accuracy of Tn based humidity estimates using daily air temperature, annual precipitation and estimated daily potential evapotranspiration. The model reduced humidity estimation errors by up to 80\% at semi-arid and arid sites and had minimal effects when Tn based humidity estimates were relatively accurate. The ratio of annual precipitation to estimated annual evapotranspiration was useful for distinguishing sites where Tn based humidity estimates were relatively accurate from sites where estimation errors were large. The results of this investigation provide a simple, more accurate method than Tn for estimating humidity in arid and semi-arid regions using general weather station data.},

For this purpose, they compare the performance of several drought indices [the standardized precipitation index (SPI); four versions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI); and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)] to predict changes in streamflow, soil moisture, forest growth, and crop yield. The authors found a superior capability of the SPEI and the SPI drought indices, which are calculated on different time scales than the Palmer indices to capture the drought impacts on the aforementioned hydrological, agricultural, and ecological variables. They detected small differences in the comparative performance of the SPI and the SPEI indices, but the SPEI was the drought index that best captured the responses of the assessed variables to drought in summer, the season in which more drought-related impacts are recorded and in which drought monitoring is critical. Hence, the SPEI shows improved capability to identify drought impacts as compared with the SPI. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of the SPEI if the responses of the variables of interest to drought are not known a priori.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aridity is a complex concept that ideally requires a comprehensive assessment of hydroclimatological and hydroecological variables to fully understand anticipated changes. A widely used (offline) impact model to assess projected changes in aridity is the aridity index (AI) (defined as the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation), summarizing the aridity concept into a single number. Based on the AI, it was shown that aridity will generally increase under conditions of increased CO2 and associated global warming. However, assessing the same climate model output directly suggests a more nuanced response of aridity to global warming, raising the question if the AI provides a good representation of the complex nature of anticipated aridity changes. By systematically comparing projections of the AI against projections for various hydroclimatological and ecohydrological variables, we show that the AI generally provides a rather poor proxy for projected aridity conditions. Direct climate model output is shown to contradict signals of increasing aridity obtained from the AI in at least half of the global land area with robust change. We further show that part of this discrepancy can be related to the parameterization of potential evaporation. Especially the most commonly used potential evaporation model likely leads to an overestimation of future aridity due to incorrect assumptions under increasing atmospheric CO2. Our results show that AI-based approaches do not correctly communicate changes projected by the fully coupled climate models. The solution is to directly analyse the model outputs rather than use a separate offline impact model. We thus urge for a direct and joint assessment of climate model output when assessing future aridity changes rather than using simple index-based impact models that use climate model output as input and are potentially subject to significant biases.},

Dry events with minimum thresholds of 10 and 20 consecutive days of precipitation with less than 2.54 mm are analyzed. For water years and cool seasons (October through March), most sites indicate negative trends in dry event length (i.e., dry event durations are becoming shorter). For the warm season (April through September), most sites also indicate negative trends; however, more sites indicate positive trends in dry event length for the warm season than for water years or cool seasons. The larger number of sites indicating positive trends in dry event length during the warm season is due to a series of dry warm seasons near the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Overall, a large portion of the variability in dry event length is attributable to variability of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, especially for water years and cool seasons. Our results are consistent with analyses of trends in discharge for sites in the southwestern United States, an increased frequency in El Niño events, and positive trends in precipitation in the southwestern United States.},

Trends in the mean length and frequency of prolonged dry episodes, as well as the number of dry days within prolonged dry episodes (DDPDE), are computed regionally and for individual stations at the threshold levels of 1 and 2 mm day−1. Regionally, the number of dry days is increasing in the summer half-year and decreasing in the winter half-year. DDPDE is significantly increasing in the summer half-year; the increased frequency of dry spells has the greatest effect. The mean length of prolonged dry episodes in the winter half-year has decreased significantly. Our results indicate that neither the frequency nor the mean length of prolonged dry episodes, alone, can adequately describe the short-term dry conditions of an area. Multiple characteristics of dry spells, including frequency, length, and the number of DDPDE should be considered. DDPDE is a function of both the frequency and length of dry episodes, but may be more influenced by one or the other characteristics of dry spells, depending on the season or region.},

Data from 2000 to 2016 was used at global scale. The global Climate Research Unit (CRU) Version 4.02 was used as reference data to assess QPE products. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index was chosen as an example to evaluate the drought utility of four QPE products. The results indicate that CHIRPS has the best performance in Europe, Oceania, and Africa; the PERSIANN-CDR has the best performance in North America, South America, and Asia; the CMORPH-BLD has the worst statistical indices in all continents. Although four QPE products showed satisfactory performance for most of the world according to SPEI statistics, poor drought monitoring ability occurred in Southeast Asia, Central Africa, the Tibetan plateau, the Himalayas, and Amazonia. The PERSIANN-CDR achieves the best performance of the four QPE products in most regions except for Africa; CHIRPS and TRMM-3B43 have comparable performances. According to the spatial probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) of the SPEI, more than 50\% of all drought events cannot be accurately identified by QPE products in regions with sparse gauge distribution. In other regions, such as the southeastern USA, southeastern China, and South Africa, QPE products capture more than 75\% of drought events. Temporally, all datasets (except for CMORPH-BLD) can detect all typical drought events, namely, in the southeastern US in 2007, western Europe in 2003, Kenya in 2006, and Central Asia in 2008. The study concludes that CHIRPS and TRMM-3B43 can be used as near-real-time drought monitoring techniques whereas PERSIANN-CDR might be more suitable for long-term historical drought analysis.},

	abstract = {North, Central, and South America (collectively referred to as the Americas) extend across two hemispheres, and together cover approximately 28\% of Earth's land area and are home to about 13\% of the world's population. Unique ecosystems, diversified cultures, and communities that inhabit the region rely on precipitation delivered yearly by multiple systems, including mid-latitudes storms, the North and South American Monsoons, and tropical storms and hurricanes. The rapid warming of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans combined with internal variability of the climate system, have modified precipitation patterns from the tropics to high latitudes. In the Americas, instrumental records have shown evidence of upward trends in extreme precipitation (amount, intensity, and frequency) in many areas. The most consistent evidence of precipitation trends occurs in mid-latitudes of North America and in the subtropics of South America. Recent studies have indicated a poleward shift of heavy precipitation associated with South American Monsoon. Nonetheless, the deficient network of rain gauges in vast areas over tropical Americas limits the assessment of trends in regions with heavy rainfall amounts. Additionally, observed trends in the North America monsoon precipitation are difficult to separate from the contribution of tropical storms and hurricanes. Furthermore, coupled modes such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation modulate precipitation in the Americas, from the tropics to the extratropics, and these teleconnections are relevant to assess precipitation trends using historical records. This review evaluates all these complex issues focusing on observations based on instrumental datasets.

Previous studies have shown that the snow hydrology of the western United States has changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Such changes manifest themselves in the form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and associated advances in streamflow “center” timing (the day in the “water-year” on average when half the water-year flow at a point has passed). However, with one exception over a more limited domain, no other study has attempted to formally attribute these changes to anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the observations together with a set of global climate model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to three major hydrological regions of the western United States—the California region, the upper Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin), it is found that the observed trends toward earlier “center” timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (significant at the {\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural parts of these changes can be attributed confidently to climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal when the analysis was performed on individual basins. It should be noted that although climate change is an important signal, other climatic processes have also contributed to the hydrologic variability of large basins in the western United States.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

This reduction has important social and economic implications, as water retained in the snowpack from winter storms forms an important part of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the region. A formal model-based detection and attribution (D–A) study of these reductions is performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) to water-year-to-date precipitation ({\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater}), chosen to reduce the effect of {\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} variability on the results. Estimates of natural internal climate variability are obtained from 1600 years of two control simulations performed with fully coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the SWE/{\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and some aerosols are taken from multiple-member ensembles of perturbation experiments run with two models. The D–A shows the observations and anthropogenically forced models have greater SWE/{\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} reductions than can be explained by natural internal climate variability alone. Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/{\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} reductions. The mean model estimate is that about half of the SWE/{\textless}em{\textgreater}P{\textless}/em{\textgreater} reductions observed in the west from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Long and temporally consistent rainfall time series are essential in climate analyses and applications. Rainfall data from station observations are inadequate over many parts of the world due to sparse or non-existent observation networks, or limited reporting of gauge observations. As a result, satellite rainfall estimates have been used as an alternative or as a supplement to station observations. However, many satellite-based rainfall products with long time series suffer from coarse spatial and temporal resolutions and inhomogeneities caused by variations in satellite inputs. There are some satellite rainfall products with reasonably consistent time series, but they are often limited to specific geographic areas. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) and CHIRP combined with station observations (CHIRPS) are recently produced satellite-based rainfall products with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions and quasi-global coverage. In this study, CHIRP and CHIRPS were evaluated over East Africa at daily, dekadal (10-day) and monthly time-scales. The evaluation was done by comparing the satellite products with rain-gauge data from about 1,200 stations. The CHIRP and CHIRPS products were also compared with two similar operational satellite rainfall products: the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) and the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data (TAMSAT). The results show that both CHIRP and CHIRPS products are significantly better than ARC2 with higher skill and low or no bias. These products were also found to be slightly better than the latest version of the TAMSAT product at dekadal and monthly time-scales, while TAMSAT performed better at the daily time-scale. The performance of the different satellite products exhibits high spatial variability with weak performances over coastal and mountainous regions.},

	abstract = {Accurate long-term estimates of precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution are vital for several applications ranging from hydrometeorology to climatology. The availability of a good network of rain gauges, and high precipitation variability associated with two annual monsoon systems and complex topography make India a suitable test-bed to assess the performance of any satellite-based precipitation product. This study assesses the performance of latest versions of four multi-satellite precipitation products: (i) Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), (ii) Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), (iii) SM2RAIN-Climate Change Initiative (SM2RAIN-CCI), and (iv) TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) across India using gauge-based observations for the period of 1998–2015 at monthly scale. These four multi-satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets. Among these multi-satellite precipitation products, SM2RAIN-CCI is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment. Results indicate that CHIRPS and TMPA are comparable to gauge-based precipitation estimates at all-India and sub-regional scales followed by MSWEP estimates. However, SM2RAIN-CCI largely underestimates precipitation across the country as compared to gauge-based observations. The systematic error component in SM2RAIN-CCI dominates as compared to random error component, which suggests the need of a suitable bias correction to SM2RAIN-CCI before integrating it in any application. The overall results indicate that CHIRPS data set could be used for long-term precipitation analyses with rather higher confidence.},

	abstract = {Trend analyses are common in several types of climate change studies. In many cases, finding evidence that the trends are different from zero in hydroclimate variables is of particular interest. However, when estimating the confidence interval of a set of hydroclimate stations or gridded data the spatial correlation between can affect the significance assessment using for example traditional non-parametric and parametric methods. For this reason, Monte Carlo simulations are needed in order to generate maps of corrected trend significance. In this article, we determined the significance of trends in aridity, modeled runoff using the Variable Infiltration Capacity Macroscale Hydrological model, Hagreaves potential evapotranspiration (PET) and near-surface temperature in Central America. Linear-regression models were fitted considering that the predictor variable is the time variable (years from 1970 to 1999) and predictand variable corresponds to each of the previously mentioned hydroclimate variables. In order to establish if the temporal trends were significantly different from zero, a Mann Kendall and a Monte Carlo test were used. The spatial correlation was calculated first to correct the variance of each trend. It was assumed in this case that the trends form a spatial stochastic process that can be modeled as such. Results show that the analysis considering the spatial correlation proposed here can be used for identifying those extreme trends. However, a set of variables with strong spatial correlation such as temperature can have robust and widespread significant trends assuming independence, but the vast majority of the stations can still fail the Monte Carlo test. We must be vigilant of the statistically robust changes in key primary parameters such as temperature and precipitation, which are the driving sources of hydrological alterations that may affect social and environmental systems in the future.},

Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) integrates biophysical and socioeconomic information to support policy decisions. We present a CCVA of agricultural livelihoods of four countries in Central America, at the municipality level. We use the IPCC definition of vulnerability, and address the potential impact of climate change on suitability for major crops and adaptive capacity using indicators of basic human needs, as well as resources for innovation and action framed in a livelihoods approach. Adaptive capacity was estimated using ranking techniques for municipalities and descriptive multivariate analysis. Projected changes in climate suitability for crops show a wide variation between Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, and within each country. Cluster analysis of adaptive capacity values shows a gradient between higher values close to urban areas and lower values in agricultural frontier areas and in those prone to drought. Municipalities with a high proportional area under subsistence crops tend to have less resources to promote innovation and action for adaptation. Our results suggest that a full spectrum of adaptation levels and strategies must be considered in the region to achieve different adaptation goals. They also show that the adaptive capacity ranking and characterization are complementary and support geographical prioritization and identification of adaptation strategies, respectively.},

	abstract = {The Mesoamerican region is considered to be one of the areas in the world most vulnerable to climate change. We developed a framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the livelihoods of coffee growers in Mesoamerica at regional and local levels and identify adaptation strategies. Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concepts, vulnerability was defined as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To quantify exposure, changes in the climatic suitability for coffee and other crops were predicted through niche modelling based on historical climate data and locations of coffee growing areas from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Future climate projections were generated from 19 Global Circulation Models. Focus groups were used to identify nine indicators of sensitivity and eleven indicators of adaptive capacity, which were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 558 coffee producers. Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were then condensed into an index of vulnerability, and adaptation strategies were identified in participatory workshops. Models predict that all target countries will experience a decrease in climatic suitability for growing Arabica coffee, with highest suitability loss for El Salvador and lowest loss for Mexico. High vulnerability resulted from loss in climatic suitability for coffee production and high sensitivity through variability of yields and out-migration of the work force. This was combined with low adaptation capacity as evidenced by poor post harvest infrastructure and in some cases poor access to credit and low levels of social organization. Nevertheless, the specific contributors to vulnerability varied strongly among countries, municipalities and families making general trends difficult to identify. Flexible strategies for adaption are therefore needed. Families need the support of government and institutions specialized in impacts of climate change and strengthening of farmer organizations to enable the adjustment of adaptation strategies to local needs and conditions.},

Farmers in the region have adapted their activities to accommodate this phenomenon, anticipating its arrival and estimating its duration. Among the many impacts of global warming on the region are projected changes in precipitation amount, variability, and timing, with potential to affect agriculture and food security. Using gridded daily precipitation for a historic period with future projections, we characterize the MSD across much of Central America using four measures: onset date, duration, intensity, and minimum, and test for significant changes by the end of the twenty-first century. Our findings indicate that the most significant changes are for the duration, which is projected to increase by an average of over a week, and the MSD minimum precipitation, which is projected to decrease by an average of over 26\%, with statistically significant changes for the mountains and Pacific side in most of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (assuming a higher emissions pathway through the twenty-first century). These changes could portend important impacts on food security for vulnerable communities through the region. We find that for the four metrics, the changes in interannual variability are small compared to historical variability and are generally statistically insignificant.},

	abstract = {New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008–2017 using the Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re)analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convection-permitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings provide some guidance to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

	abstract = {Coffee rust is a leaf disease caused by the fungus, Hemileia vastatrix. Coffee rust epidemics, with intensities higher than previously observed, have affected a number of countries including: Colombia, from 2008 to 2011; Central America and Mexico, in 2012–13; and Peru and Ecuador in 2013. There are many contributing factors to the onset of these epidemics e.g. the state of the economy, crop management decisions and the prevailing weather, and many resulting impacts e.g. on production, on farmers’ and labourers’ income and livelihood, and on food security. Production has been considerably reduced in Colombia (by 31 \% on average during the epidemic years compared with 2007) and Central America (by 16 \% in 2013 compared with 2011–12 and by 10 \% in 2013–14 compared with 2012–13). These reductions have had direct impacts on the livelihoods of thousands of smallholders and harvesters. For these populations, particularly in Central America, coffee is often the only source of income used to buy food and supplies for the cultivation of basic grains. As a result, the coffee rust epidemic has had indirect impacts on food security. The main drivers of these epidemics are economic and meteorological. All the intense epidemics experienced during the last 37 years in Central America and Colombia were concurrent with low coffee profitability periods due to coffee price declines, as was the case in the 2012–13 Central American epidemic, or due to increases in input costs, as in the 2008–11 Colombian epidemics. Low profitability led to suboptimal coffee management, which resulted in increased plant vulnerability to pests and diseases. A common factor in the recent Colombian and Central American epidemics was a reduction in the diurnal thermal amplitude, with higher minimum/lower maximum temperatures (+0.1 °C/-0.5 °C on average during 2008–2011 compared to a low coffee rust incidence period, 1991–1994, in Chinchiná, Colombia; +0.9 °C/-1.2 °C on average in 2012 compared with prevailing climate, in 1224 farms from Guatemala). This likely decreased the latency period of the disease. These epidemics should be considered as a warning for the future, as they were enhanced by weather conditions consistent with climate change. Appropriate actions need to be taken in the near future to address this issue including: the development and establishment of resistant coffee cultivars; the creation of early warning systems; the design of crop management systems adapted to climate change and to pest and disease threats; and socio-economic solutions such as training and organisational strengthening.},

	abstract = {•Seasonal hunger is common among coffee smallholders in Nicaragua.•Domestic maize prices peak during the hungry months of June, July and August.•The number of lean months correlated negatively with corn harvests, fruit trees, improved grain storage, gross income and farm area.•Currently used agro-environmental practices showed no effect on lean months.•Fair trade cooperatives, farmers and other stakeholders can develop agroecological and local food system approaches that increase food access and sustainable land management.•Crop losses from the recent coffee leaf rust outbreak and falling commodity prices suggest that another coffee crisis is brewing in the Central America. Latin American smallholder coffee farmers linked with fair trade and organic markets are frequently cited as models for sustainable food systems. Yet many experience seasonal hunger, which is a very common, but understudied, form of food insecurity. Northern Nicaragua's highlands include well-organized cooperatives, high rural poverty rates, and rain dependent farms, offering a compelling study area to understand what factors are associated with seasonal hunger. This participatory mixed methods study combines data from observations, interviews and focus groups with results from a survey of 244 cooperative members. It finds that seasonal hunger is influenced by multiple factors, including: (1) annual cycles of precipitation and rising maize prices during the lean months; (2) inter annual droughts and periodic storms; and (3) the long-term inability of coffee harvests and prices to provide sufficient income. Sampled households experienced an average of about 3 months of seasonal hunger in 2009. A series of five least squares regression models find the expected significant impacts of corn harvest quantity, farm area, improved grain storage, and household incomes, all inversely correlated with lean months. Unanticipated results include the finding that households with more fruit trees reported fewer lean months, while the predominant environmentally friendly farming practices had no discernable impacts. The presence of hunger among producers challenges sustainable coffee marketing claims. We describe one example of a partnership-based response that integrates agroecological farm management with the use of fair trade cooperative institutions to re-localize the corn distribution system. Increased investments and integrated strategies will be needed to reduce threats to food security, livelihoods, and biodiversity associated with the rapid spread of coffee leaf rust and falling commodity prices.},

Particular emphasis was given to the North American monsoon (NAM) and the mid-summer drought (MSD) regions. The three RCMs show negative (positive) temperature (precipitation) biases over the mountains, where observations have more problems due to poor data coverage. Observations from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and ERA-Interim show a generalized warming over the domain. The most significant warming trend (≥0.34°C/decade) is observed in the NAM, which is moderately captured by the three RCMs, but with less intensity; each decade from 1970 to 2016 has become warmer than the previous ones, especially during the summer (mean and extremes); this warming appears partially related to the positive Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (+AMO). CRU, GPCP, and CHIRPS show significant decreases of precipitation (less than ?15\%/decade) in parts of the southwest United States and northwestern Mexico, including the NAM, and a positive trend (5?10\%/decade) in June?September in eastern Mexico, the MSD region, and northern South America, but longer trends (1950?2017) are not statistically significant. RCMs are able to moderately simulate some of the recent trends, especially in winter. In spite of their mean biases, the RCMs are able to adequately simulate inter-annual and seasonal variations. Wet (warm) periods in regions affected by the MSD are significantly correlated with the +AMO and La Niña events (+AMO and El Niño). Summer precipitation trends from GPCP show opposite signs to those of CRU and CHIRPS over the Mexican coasts of the southern Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, and Cuba, possibly due to data limitations and differences in grid resolutions.},

We look at trends across four different regions (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western), for three different seasons (May to July, August to October and November to April) and for three different periods (1901?2012, 1951?2012 and 1979?2012). There are no century-long trends in precipitation in either data set, although all regions (with the exception of the Northern Caribbean) show decade-long periods of wetter or drier conditions. The most significant of these is for the Southern Caribbean region which was wetter than the 1961?1990 average from 1940 to 1956 and then drier from 1957 to 1965. Temperature in contrast shows statistically significant warming everywhere for the periods 1901?2012, 1951?2012 and for over half the area during 1979?2012. Data availability is a limiting issue over much of the region and we also discuss the reliability of the series we use in the context of what is known to be available in the CRU TS 3.21 data set.

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The derivation of local scale information from integrations of coarse-resolution general circulation models (GCM) with the help of statistical models fitted to present observations is generally referred to as statistical downscaling. In this paper a relatively simple analog method is described and applied for downscaling purposes. According to this method the large-scale circulation simulated by a GCM is associated with the local variables observed simultaneously with the most similar large scale circulation pattern in a pool of historical observations. The similarity of the large-scale circulation patterns is defined in terms of their coordinates in the space spanned by the leading observed empirical orthogonal functions. The method can be checked by replicating the evolution of the local variables in an independent period. Its performance for monthly and daily winter rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula is compared to more complicated techniques, each belonging to one of the broad families of existing statistical downscaling techniques: a method based on canonical correlation analysis, as representative of linear methods; a method based on classification and regression trees, as representative of a weather generator based on classification methods; and a neural network, as an example of deterministic nonlinear methods. It is found in these applications that the analog method performs in general as well as the more complicated methods, and it can be applied to both normally and nonnormally distributed local variables. Furthermore, it produces the right level of variability of the local variable and preserves the spatial covariance between local variables. On the other hand linear multivariate methods offer a clearer physical interpretation that supports more strongly its validity in an altered climate. Classification and neural networks are generally more complicated methods and do not directly offer a physical interpretation.},

In order for government agencies and design engineers to incorporate these trends and future changes into assessment and design processes, tools for planning and design should be capable of considering nonstationary climate conditions. In this work, potential changes are investigated in intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves, which are often used for assessment of extreme rainfall events, using historic data and future climate projections. An approach is proposed for calculating IDF curves that incorporates projected changes in rainfall intensity at a range of locations in the United States. The results elucidate strong regional patterns in projected changes in rainfall intensity, which are influenced by the rainfall characteristics of the region. Therefore, impacts of climate change on extreme hydrologic events will be highly regional and thus such assessments should be performed for specific project locations.},

Seven scenarios based on the so-called SRES emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were used to describe changes in climate and land use. Shifts in runoff regimes and annual and summer runoff were investigated. The focus was on analyzing differences in the hydrological responses of different Alpine climate zones, exploring differences between SRES scenarios ( A1FI, A2, B1, and B2), and analyzing the importance of applying several global circulation models ( HadCM3, CGCM2, CSIRO2, and PCM). Under all scenarios, rising temperatures were projected to strongly affect runoff regimes via the impact on snow cover. The overall effect is a substantial runoff regime shift across the Alps, with specific differences depending on the climatic zone considered.},

The innovation of the proposed dynamical/statistical hybrid approach lies on having unraveled a link between larger-scale dynamics of the atmosphere and smaller-scale statistics of the rainfall fields [Perica and Foufoula-Georgiou, 1996a], which then permits the coupling of a mesoscale dynamical model with a small-scale statistical parameterization of rainfall. This coupling is two-way interactive and offers the capability of investigating the feedback effects of subgrid-scale rainfall spatial variability on the further development of a rainfall system and on the surface energy balance and water partitioning over the MM5 model grids. The results of simulating rainfall in a strong convection system observed during the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central (PRESTORM) on June 10-11, 1985 show that (1) the dynamical/statistical hybrid approach is a useful and cost-effective scheme to predict rainfall at subgrid scales (around 1 km) based on larger-scale atmospheric model predictions, and (2) the inclusion of the subgrid-scale rainfall spatial variability can significantly affect the surface temperature distribution and the short-term ({\textless} 24 hour) prediction of rainfall intensity.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Grid-scale precipitation data were derived from synoptic-scale fields of 50 kPa geopotentials by a simple method that relates synoptic-scale circulation to local climate. The study addressed the concerns that: (i) different sizes of grids might affect the results; (ii) different gridpoint spacing might affect the results; (iii) days that remain unclassified might be important to precipitation delivery. Three different grids were used. Grid A is 45 points with a 3.7 degrees x 3.7 degrees spacing with limited spatial coverage; Grid B is 117 points on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid which covered most of North America and the north-eastern Pacific Ocean; and Grid C is 35 points on a 10 degrees x 10 degrees grid with the same area as Grid B. The Kirchhofer technique was applied, and generated 20 (Grid A), 18 (Grid B), and 14 (Grid C) different synoptic types from a 10-year sample data set (1960-1969). Comparisons between simulated and observed precipitation for 1970-1989 showed that the method produced compatible precipitation totals regardless of which grid was employed, but the simulated variability was too low. Grid B gave the closest agreement between simulated and observed precipitation, with Grids C and A being ranked second and third, respectively. The spatial coverage of the grid was therefore deemed to be more important than the number of grid points within it. Similar results were found when comparing observed precipitation with that generated using general circulation model (GCM) geopotential height data. Precipitation regimes generated from the GCM suggest that little change in the synoptic control of precipitation would arise from a doubling of atmospheric CO2.

	abstract = {[ 1] Changes in the height of the tropopause provide a sensitive indicator of human effects on climate. A previous attempt to identify human effects on tropopause height relied on information from 'first-generation' reanalyses of past weather observations. Climate data from these initial model-based reanalyses have well-documented deficiencies, raising concerns regarding the robustness of earlier detection work that employed these data. Here we address these concerns using information from the new second-generation ERA-40 reanalysis. Over 1979 to 2001, tropopause height increases by nearly 200 m in ERA-40, partly due to tropospheric warming. The spatial pattern of height increase is consistent with climate model predictions of the expected response to anthropogenic influences alone, significantly strengthening earlier detection results. Atmospheric temperature changes in two different satellite data sets are more highly correlated with changes in ERA-40 than with those in a first-generation reanalysis, illustrating the improved quality of temperature information in ERA-40. Our results provide support for claims that human activities have warmed the troposphere and cooled the lower stratosphere over the last several decades of the 20th century, and that both of these changes in atmospheric temperature have contributed to an overall increase in tropopause height.},

	abstract = {In a recent multimodel detection and attribution (D\&A) study using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated “fingerprint” pattern of anthropogenically caused changes in water vapor was identifiable with high statistical confidence in satellite data. Each model received equal weight in the D\&A analysis, despite large differences in the skill with which they simulate key aspects of observed climate. Here, we examine whether water vapor D\&A results are sensitive to model quality. The “top 10” and “bottom 10” models are selected with three different sets of skill measures and two different ranking approaches. The entire D\&A analysis is then repeated with each of these different sets of more or less skillful models. Our performance metrics include the ability to simulate the mean state, the annual cycle, and the variability associated with El Niño. We find that estimates of an anthropogenic water vapor fingerprint are insensitive to current model uncertainties, and are governed by basic physical processes that are well-represented in climate models. Because the fingerprint is both robust to current model uncertainties and dissimilar to the dominant noise patterns, our ability to identify an anthropogenic influence on observed multidecadal changes in water vapor is not affected by “screening” based on model quality.},

	abstract = {Estimation and prediction of the amount of rainfall in time and space is a problem of fundamental importance in many applications in agriculture, hydrology, and ecology. Stochastic simulation of rainfall data is also an important step in the development of stochastic downscaling: methods where large- scale climate information is considered as an additional explanatory variable of rainfall behavior at the local scale. Simulated rainfall has also been used as input data for many agricultural, hydrological, and ecological models, especially when rainfall measurements are not available for locations of interest or when historical records are not of sufficient length to evaluate important rainfall characteristics as extreme values. Rainfall estimation and prediction were carried out for an agricultural region of Venezuela in the central plains state of Guarico, where rainfall for 10-day periods is available for 80 different locations. The measurement network is relatively sparse for some areas, and aggregated rainfall at time resolutions of days or less is of very poor quality or nonexistent. We consider a model for rainfall based on a truncated normal distribution that has been proposed in the literature. We assume that the data y(it), where i indexes location and t indexes time, correspond to normal random variates w(it) that have been truncated and transformed. According to this model, the dry periods correspond to the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to a transformation of the positive ones. The serial structure present in series of rainfall data can be modeled by considering a stochastic process for w(it) We use a dynamic linear model on w(t) = (w(1t),...,w(Nt)) that includes a Fourier representation to allow for the seasonality of the data that is assumed to be the same for all sites, plus a linear combination of functions of the location of each site. This approach captures year-to-year variability and provides a tool for short-term forecasting. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses latent variables to handle dry periods and missing values.},

Two primary causes are identified: 1) more extreme and earlier storms and 2) warming temperatures that shift precipitation from snow to rain dominance over regional terrain. The simulations also show a wide range of uncertainty among different basins stemming from localized storm characteristics. While previous research using statistical downscaling suggests that many areas in the Pacific Northwest are likely to experience substantial increases in flooding in response to global climate change, these initial estimates do not adequately represent the effects of changes in heavy precipitation. Unlike statistical downscaling techniques applied to global climate model scenarios, the regional model provides an explicit, physically based simulation of the seasonality, size, location, and intensity of historical and future extreme storms, including atmospheric rivers. This paper presents climate projections from the ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM) global climate model dynamically downscaled using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model implemented at 12-km resolution for the period 1970?2069. The resulting daily precipitation and temperature data are bias corrected and used as input to a physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. From the daily time step simulations of streamflow produced by the hydrologic model, probability distributions are fit to the extreme events extracted from each water year and flood statistics for various return intervals are estimated.},

	abstract = {An ensemble of models can be interpreted in two ways. The first treats each model as an approximation of the true system with some random error. Alternatively, the true system can be interpreted as a sample drawn from a distribution of models, such that model and truth are statistically indistinguishable. Both interpretations are ubiquitous and have different consequences for the uncertainty of model projections, but are rarely defended. Here we argue that the two seemingly conflicting views are in fact complementary, and the interpretation of the ensemble may evolve seamlessly from the former to the latter. We show some \&\#8216;truth plus error\&\#8217; like properties exist for historical and present day climate simulations in the CMIP archive, and that they can be explained by the ensemble design and tuning to observations, although both models and tuning are imperfect. For future projections, structural differences in model response arise which are independent of the present day state and thus the \&\#8216;indistinguishable\&\#8217; interpretation is increasingly favored. Our inability to define performance metrics that identify \&\#8216;good\&\#8217; and \&\#8216;bad\&\#8217; models can be explained by the models having largely exploited the available observations. The remaining model error is largely structural and the observations are often uninformative to further reduce model biases or reduce the range of projections covered by the ensemble. The discussion here is motivated by the use of multi model ensembles in climate projections, but the arguments are generic to any situation where multiple different models constrained by observations are used to describe the same system.},

Root Mean Square Error, linear correlation, and Brier score show better agreement with the observations as spatiotemporal scale increases but the skill for the regional (5° × 5° \&\#8211; 20° × 20° grid) and decadal (10 \&\#8211; \&\#8764;30-year trends) scales is rather limited. Rapid improvements are seen across 30° × 30° grid to zonal average and around 30 years, although they depend on the performance statistics. Rather abrupt change in the performance from 30° × 30° grid to zonal average implies that averaging out longitudinal features, such as land-ocean contrast, might significantly improve the reliability of the simulated SAT trend. The mean bias and ensemble spread relative to the observed variability, which are crucial to the reliability of the ensemble distribution, are not necessarily improved with increasing scales and may impact probabilistic predictions more at longer temporal scales. No significant differences are found in the performance of CMIP3 and CMIP5 at the large spatiotemporal scales, but at smaller scales the CMIP5 ensemble often shows better correlation and Brier score, indicating improvements in the CMIP5 on the temporal dynamics of SAT at regional and decadal scales.},

The approach involves a combination of Neural Network tools and traditional weather forecasting techniques. A Neural Network transfer function is developed to relate local wind speed observations to large scale GCM predictions of atmospheric properties under current climatic conditions. By assuming the invariability of this transfer function under conditions of doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide, the resulting transfer function is then applied to GCM output for a transient run of the National Center for Atmospheric Research coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. This methodology is applied to three test sites in regions relevant to the wind power industry-one in Texas and two in California. Changes in daily mean wind speeds at each location are presented and discussed with respect to potential implications for wind power generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The GISS coupled atmosphere-ocean model is used to investigate the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 by comparing a compounded 1\% CO2 increase experiment with a control simulation. After 70 yr of integration, the global surface air temperature in the 1\% CO2 experiment is 1.43 degrees C warmer. In spite of this global warming, there are two distinct regions, the northern Atlantic Ocean and the southern Pacific Ocean, where the surface air temperature is up to 4 degrees C cooler. This situation is maintained by two positive feedbacks: a local effect on convection in the South Pacific and a nonlocal impact on the meridional circulation in the North Atlantic. The poleward transport of latent energy and dry static energy by the atmosphere is greater in the 1\% CO2 experiment, caused by warming and therefore increased water vapor and greater greenhouse capacity at lower latitudes. The larger atmospheric transports tend to reduce upward vertical fluxes of heat and moisture from the ocean surface at high latitudes, which has the effect of stabilizing the ocean, reducing both convection and the thermohaline circulation. With less convection, less warm water is brought up from below, and with a reduced North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (by 30\% at time of CO2 doubling), the poleward energy transport by the oceans decreases. The colder water then leads to further reductions in evaporation, decreases of salinity at high latitudes, continued stabilization of the ocean, and maintenance of reduced convection and meridional overturning. Although sea ice decreases globally, it increases in the cooling regions, which reduces the overall climate sensitivity, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. Tropical warming has been observed over the past several decades; if modeling studies such as this and others that have produced similar effects are valid, these processes may already be beginning.},

Surface air temperature trends in the two GHG experiments (with tl-le control simulations climate drift subtracted out) are compared between themselves and with changes in the observed temperature record between 1960 and 1998. All comparisons show high positive spatial correlation in the Northern Hemisphere except in summer when the greenhouse signal is weakest. The GHG + SO4 experiments show weaker correlations. In the Southern Hemisphere, correlations between any experiments ol observations are either weak or negative, in part because the model's interannual variability of southern sea ice cover is unrealistic. The model results imply that temperature changes due to forcing by increased greenhouse gases have risen above the level of regional interannual temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 40 years. This period is thus an important test of the reliability of coupled climate models.},

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {To fully take advantage of regional climate forecast information for agricultural applications, the relationship between regional and station scale precipitation characteristics must be quantified. The spatial variability of precipitation within a region is defined by differences between station and regional standardised values. The spatial variability is quantified at the monthly, seasonal and yearly time scales for the central Oklahoma "super climate division" and the four "climate divisions" included in. For the super climate division, the standard deviation of the differences between station and regional standardised values ranges from minimum values during the winter around 0,55 to maximum values during the summer around 0,80. The decrease of the spatial variability associated with the increase of the time scale is of about 35\% from month to season, of about 45\% from season to year. Whereas the decrease of spatial variability associated with the decrease in space scale is of about 35\% from super- climate division to climate division. An analysis of the distribution of the differences allows to define confidence envelope for local precipitation around the regional value. This study clearly demonstrates the critical influence of the spatial variability of precipitation and the additional uncertainty it introduces in the downscaling of regional information to local applications.

The change in variability of temperature and precipitation in a transient climate simulation, where trace gases are allowed to increase gradually, and in the doubled CO2 climate is investigated using the GISS general circulation model. The current climate control run is compared with observations and with the climate change simulations for variability on three time-scales: interannual variability, daily variability, and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle. The results show that the modeled variability is often larger than observed, especially in late summer, possibly due to the crude ground hydrology. In the warmer climates, temperature variability and the diurnal cycle amplitude usually decrease, in conjunction with a decrease in the latitudinal temperature gradient and the increased greenhouse inhibition of radiative cooling. Precipitation variability generally changes with the same sign as the mean precipitation itself, usually increasing in the warmer climate. Changes at a particular grid box are often not significant, with the prevailing tendency determined from a broader sampling. Little change is seen in daily persistence. The results are relevant to the continuing assessments of climate change impacts on society, though their use should be tempered by appreciation of the model deficiencies for the current climate.},

	abstract = {AbstractGlobal climate model simulations inherently contain multiple biases that, when used as boundary conditions for regional climate models, have the potential to produce poor downscaled simulations. Removing these biases before downscaling can potentially improve regional climate change impact assessment. In particular, reducing the low-frequency variability biases in atmospheric variables as well as modeled rainfall is important for hydrological impact assessment, predominantly for the improved simulation of floods and droughts. The impact of this bias in the lateral boundary conditions driving the dynamical downscaling has not been explored before. Here the use of three approaches for correcting the lateral boundary biases including mean, variance, and modification of sample moments through the use of a nested bias correction (NBC) method that corrects for low-frequency variability bias is investigated. These corrections are implemented at the 6-hourly time scale on the global climate model simulations to drive a regional climate model over the Australian Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domain. The results show that the most substantial improvement in low-frequency variability after bias correction is obtained from modifying the mean field, with smaller changes attributed to the variance. Explicitly modifying monthly and annual lag-1 autocorrelations through NBC does not substantially improve low-frequency variability attributes of simulated precipitation in the regional model over a simpler mean bias correction. These results raise questions about the nature of bias correction techniques that are required to successfully gain improvement in regional climate model simulations and show that more complicated techniques do not necessarily lead to more skillful simulation.},

	abstract = {A statistical modeling approach is proposed for the simulation of local paleoclimatic proxy records using general circulation model (GCM) output, A method for model-consistent statistical downscaling to local weather conditions is developed which can be used as input for process-based proxy models in order to investigate to what extent climate variability obtained from proxy data can be represented by a GCM, and whether, for example, the response of glaciers to climatic change can be reproduced. Downscaling is based on a multiple linear forward regression model using daily sets of operational weather station data and large-scale predictors at various pressure levels obtained from reanalyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Composition and relative impact of predictors vary significantly for individual. stations within the area of investigation. Owing to a strong dependence on individual synoptic-scale patterns, daily data give the highest performance which can be further increased by developing seasonal-specific relationships. The model is applied to a long integration of a GCM coupled to a mixed layer ocean (ECHAM4/MLO) simulating present-day and preindustrial climate variability. Patterns of variability are realistically simulated compared to observed station data within an area of Norway for the period 1868-1993.},

Crop simulators require daily input of environmental variables. GCMs produce monthly projections of climatic variables. Our objective was to explore the possibility of using monthly weather projections in yield estimates. We considered atmospheric CO2 level, total solar radiation, average maximum and minimum temperature, and rainfall for five months of the growing season. The group method of data handling (GMDH) was applied to relate crop yields to these variables. Projections of GCMs were downscaled to provide daily weather variables for the Mississippi Delta, and weather patterns were obtained in 50 replications for each GCM. The soybean crop simulator GLYCIM was used to generate crop yields on sandy loam, loam and silt loam soils. The equations built with GMDH explained 81-85\% of yield variability, acid included solar radiation in July and August, CO2 level, minimum temperature in June and August, and rainfall in August.

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Tree ring chronologies provide long-term records of growth in natural environmental conditions and may be used to evaluate impacts of climatic change and CO2 increase on forest productivity. This study focuses on 21 Pinus halepensis forest stands in calcareous Provence (in the south-east of France). A chronology of net primary productivity (NPP) both for the 20th century and for each stand was estimated using tree ring data (width and density). The response of each stand to climate in terms of NPP was statistically modelled using response functions. Anomalies between estimated NPP and NPP reconstructed by response functions were calculated to evaluate the fertilising effect of CO2 increase on tree growth. The changes in anomalies during the 20th century were attributed to the effect of CO2 increase. A multiplying factor (beta) linking CO2 concentration and stand productivity was then calculated, on the basis of the trend observed during the 20th century. In this study, the value of the beta factor obtained under natural conditions (beta = 0.50) is consistent with those from controlled CO2 enrichment experiments. Both response functions and the beta factor were used to predict NPP changes for a 2 X CO2 scenario. The 2 X CO2 climate was obtained using predictions from Meteo France's ARPEGE atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) downscaled to Marseilles meteorological station. NPP increased significantly for nine stands solely when the climatic effect was taken into account. The main factors responsible for this enhancement were increased winter and early spring temperatures. When the fertilising effect of the CO2 increase was added, NPP was significantly enhanced for 14 stands (i.e. NPP enhancement ranged from 8\% to 55\%). Although the effects of global change were slightly detectable during the 20th century, their acceleration is likely to lead to great changes in the future productivity of P. halepensis forests.

The project involves updating and advancing previous studies on climate change in California. Climate data are based on new Global Circulation Model output from the statistical downscaling that converts GCM climate forecasts into local weather forecasts. The project applies these climate data to perturb an existing 72-year historical hydrologic time series of the San Joaquin Basin to develop an integrated impacts analysis of climate change/variability on the water, economic and social resources of the Basin. Previous studies focused only on water resource impacts. A decision support system (DSS) is under development that will provide assistance to CALFED (a joint California State and Federal program designed to resolve water issues in the Bay-Delta) in water resource and ecosystem management of the San Joaquin Basin.

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Because of a lack of observations, historical simulations of land surface conditions using land surface models are needed for studying variability and changes in the continental water cycle and for providing initial conditions for seasonal climate predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also needed for land surface model development. The quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects the ability of land surface models to realistically simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully constructed global forcing dataset for 1948\&\#8211;2004 with 3-hourly and T62 (\&\#8764;1.875\&\#176;) resolution is described, and historical simulations using the latest version of the Community Land Model version 3.0 (CLM3) are evaluated using available observations of streamflow, continental freshwater discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture. The forcing dataset was derived by combining observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation and surface air temperature with intramonthly variations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\&\#8211;National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\&\#8211;NCAR) reanalysis, which is shown to have spurious trends and biases in surface temperature and precipitation. Surface downward solar radiation from the reanalysis was first adjusted for variations and trends using monthly station records of cloud cover anomaly and then for mean biases using satellite observations during recent decades. Surface specific humidity from the reanalysis was adjusted using the adjusted surface air temperature and reanalysis relative humidity. Surface wind speed and air pressure were interpolated directly from the 6-hourly reanalysis data. Sensitivity experiments show that the precipitation adjustment (to the reanalysis data) leads to the largest improvement, while the temperature and radiation adjustments have only small effects. When forced by this dataset, the CLM3 reproduces many aspects of the long-term mean, annual cycle, interannual and decadal variations, and trends of streamflow for many large rivers (e.g., the Orinoco, Changjiang, Mississippi, etc.), although substantial biases exist. The simulated long-term-mean freshwater discharge into the global and individual oceans is comparable to 921 river-based observational estimates. Observed soil moisture variations over Illinois and parts of Eurasia are generally simulated well, with the dominant influence coming from precipitation. The results suggest that the CLM3 simulations are useful for climate change analysis. It is also shown that unrealistically low intensity and high frequency of precipitation, as in most model-simulated precipitation or observed time-averaged fields, result in too much evaporation and too little runoff, which leads to lower than observed river flows. This problem can be reduced by adjusting the precipitation rates using observed-precipitation frequency maps.},

Climatic conditions, such as wet and dry spells, interannual variability and agroclimatic indices, were also used to assess the performance of the 2 weather generators. AAFC-WG performed better in simulating temperature -related statistics, while it did almost as well as LARS-WG for statistics associated with daily precipitation. Using empirical distributions in AAFC-WG for daily maximum and minimum temperatures helped to improve the temperature statistics, especially in cases where local temperatures did not follow normal distributions. However, both weather generators had overdispersion problems, i.e. they underestimated interannual variability, especially for temperatures. Overall, AAFC-WG performed better.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {The issues of downscaling the results from global climate models (GCMs) to a scale relevant for hydrological impact studies are examined. GCM outputs, typically at a spatial resolution of around 3degrees latitude and 4degrees longitude, are currently not considered reliable at time scales shorter than I month. Continuous rainfall-runoff modelling for flood regime assessment requires input at the daily or even hourly time-step. A review of the different methodologies suggested in the literature to downscale GCM results at smaller spatial and temporal resolutions is presented. The methods, from simple interpolation to more sophisticated dynamical modelling, through multiple regression and weather generators, are, however, mostly based directly on GCM outputs, sometimes at daily time-step. The approach adopted is a simple, empirical methodology based on modelled monthly changes from the HadCM2 greenhouse gases experiment for the time horizon 2050s. Three daily rainfall scenarios are derived from the same set of monthly changes, representing different possible changes in the rainfall regime. The first scenario represents an increase of the occurrence of frontal systems, corresponding to a decrease in the rainfall intensity; the second corresponds to an increase in convective storm-type rainfall, characterized by extreme events with higher intensity; the third one assumes an increase in the monthly rainfall without any change in rainfall variability. A continuous daily rainfall-runoff model, calibrated for the Severn catchment, was used to generate daily flow series for the 1961-90 baseline period and the 2050s, and a peaks-over-threshold analysis was undertaken to produce flood frequency distributions for the two time horizons. Though the three scenarios lead to an increase in the magnitude and the frequency of the extreme flood events, the impact is strongly influenced by the type of daily rainfall scenario applied. We conclude that if the next generation of GCMs produce more reliable rainfall variance estimates, then more appropriate ways of deriving rainfall scenarios could be developed using weather generators rather than empirical methods.

	abstract = {Assessing future climate and its potential implications on river flows is a key challenge facing water resource planners. Sound, scientifically-based advice to decision makers also needs to incorporate information on the uncertainty in the results. Moreover, existing bias in the reproduction of the ‘current’ (or baseline) river flow regime is likely to transfer to the simulations of flow in future time horizons, and it is thus critical to undertake baseline flow assessment while undertaking future impacts studies. This paper investigates the three main sources of uncertainty surrounding climate change impact studies on river flows: uncertainty in GCMs, in downscaling techniques and in hydrological modelling. The study looked at four British catchments’ flow series simulated by a lumped conceptual rainfall–runoff model with observed and GCM-derived rainfall series representative of the baseline time horizon (1961–1990). A block-resample technique was used to assess climate variability, either from observed records (natural variability) or reproduced by GCMs. Variations in mean monthly flows due to hydrological model uncertainty from different model structures or model parameters were also evaluated. Three GCMs (HadCM3, CCGCM2, and CSIRO-mk2) and two downscaling techniques (SDSM and HadRM3) were considered. Results showed that for all four catchments, GCM uncertainty is generally larger than downscaling uncertainty, and both are consistently greater than uncertainty from hydrological modelling or natural variability. No GCM or downscaling technique was found to be significantly better or to have a systematic bias smaller than the others. This highlights the need to consider more than one GCM and downscaling technique in impact studies, and to assess the bias they introduce when modelling river flows.},

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Monthly precipitation in Hungary is modeled using the Hess- Brezowsky atmospheric circulation pattern types and an ENSO index as forcing functions or inputs. The weakness of the statistical dependence between these individual inputs and precipitation prevents the use of a multivariate regression analysis for reproducing the probability distribution function of observed precipitation. In order to utilize the existing relationship between forcing functions and precipitation a fuzzy rule-based modeling technique is used. The first part of the observed input and precipitation data is used as the learning set to identify the fuzzy rules. Then, the second part of the data is used to validate the rules by comparing the frequency distributions of precipitation calculated respectively with the fuzzy rules and observed data. Example results are presented for two different climatic regions of Hungary. One of them represents a wetter climate while the other refers to the drier conditions of the Hungarian Plains. The fuzzy rule-based model reproduces the empirical frequency distributions in every season. However, as expected, the statistical prediction is better in winter, spring and fall than in the summer. The potential of the approach is important in climate change studies when the fuzzy rules obtained as described above can be used with input data stemming from GCM to predict regional/local precipitation reflecting GCM scenarios.

	abstract = {By applying the dynamical cluster algorithm to large-scale circulation patterns at various tropospheric levels (Z700, Z500, and SLP [sea-level pressure]), we obtain the so-called weather regimes (WRs). WRs are the cluster central patterns; there is no subjectivity at all involved in the procedure, A red noise test allows one to select the best number of clusters at each level. A comparison is performed between the different level classifications, and highly significant correlations are found. While previous attempts to classify daily circulations in a fully objective way were concerned with mid-tropospheric levels and could not go further back than 50 yr, here we classify 120 yr of SLP patterns. We arrive at the important conclusion that the same 5 WRs are found for the 3 periods 1880-1918, 1919-1957 and 1958-1997. The linkage between these WRs and the local tangible weather is then investigated for both temperatures and precipitation. It is found that the instantaneous departure of local weather from average climate is highly correlated with the WRs, making this approach a challenging and coherent description of local climates. The atmosphere does not merely evolve around its mean state, but instead spends more time around a few peculiar (large-scale) states with specific consequences for local weather. As a result, the WRs may provide a reliable (and moreover fully objective) framework for building downscaling algorithms appropriate for local climate change studies.},

	doi = {doi:10.1175/JHM-D-14-0082.1},
	abstract = {AbstractA new technique for statistically downscaling climate model simulations of daily temperature and precipitation is introduced and demonstrated over the western United States. The localized constructed analogs (LOCA) method produces downscaled estimates suitable for hydrological simulations using a multiscale spatial matching scheme to pick appropriate analog days from observations. First, a pool of candidate observed analog days is chosen by matching the model field to be downscaled to observed days over the region that is positively correlated with the point being downscaled, which leads to a natural independence of the downscaling results to the extent of the domain being downscaled. Then, the one candidate analog day that best matches in the local area around the grid cell being downscaled is the single analog day used there. Most grid cells are downscaled using only the single locally selected analog day, but locations whose neighboring cells identify a different analog day use a weighted combination of the center and adjacent analog days to reduce edge discontinuities. By contrast, existing constructed analog methods typically use a weighted average of the same 30 analog days for the entire domain. By greatly reducing this averaging, LOCA produces better estimates of extreme days, constructs a more realistic depiction of the spatial coherence of the downscaled field, and reduces the problem of producing too many light-precipitation days. The LOCA method is more computationally expensive than existing constructed analog techniques, but it is still practical for downscaling numerous climate model simulations with limited computational resources.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Analysing the impact of future climate change on hydrological regimes is hampered by the disparity of scales between general circulation model (GCM) output and the spatial resolution required by catchment-scale hydrological simulation models. In order to overcome this, statistical relationships were established between three indices of atmospheric circulation (vorticity and the strength and direction of geostrophic windflow) and daily catchment precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) to downscale from the HadCM2 GCM to the Upper Wye experimental catchment in mid-Wales. The atmospheric circulation indices were calculated from daily grid point sea-level pressure data for: (a) the Climatic Research Unit observed data set (1975-90); (b) the HadCM2SUL simulation representing the present climate (1980-99); and (c) the HadCM2SUL simulation representing future climate conditions (2080-99). The performance of the downscaling approach was evaluated by comparing diagnostic statistics from the three downscaled precipitation and PET scenarios with those recorded from the Upper Wye catchment. The most significant changes between the downscaled HadCM2SUL 1980-99 and 2080-99 scenarios are decreases in precipitation occurrence and amount in summer and autumn combined with a shortening of mean wet spell length, which is most pronounced in autumn. A hydrological simulation model (HYSIM) was calibrated on recorded flow data for the Upper Wye catchment and 'forced' with the three downscaled precipitation and PET scenarios to model changes in river flow and hillslope hydrological processes. Results indicate increased seasonality of flows, with markedly drier summers. Analysis of extreme events suggests significant increases in the frequency of both high- and low-flow events.

	abstract = {AbstractGlobal climate model (GCM) output typically needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for climate change impact studies. Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM?s mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2°C and 30\% points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent bias correction method is introduced that is twice as effective as standard bias correction in reducing errors in the models? simulation of variance as a function of frequency, and it does so without making any locations worse, unlike standard bias correction. Last, a preconditioning technique is introduced that improves the simulation of the annual cycle while still allowing the bias correction to take account of an entire season?s values at once.},

	abstract = {The significant worldwide increase in observed river runoff has been tentatively attributed to the stomatal â€œantitranspirantâ€ response of plants to rising atmospheric CO [Gedney N, Cox PM, Betts RA, Boucher O, Huntingford C, Stott PA (2006) 439: 835â€“838]. However, CO also is a plant fertilizer. When allowing for the increase in foliage area that results from increasing atmospheric CO levels in a global vegetation model, we find a decrease in global runoff from 1901 to 1999. This finding highlights the importance of vegetation structure feedback on the water balance of the land surface. Therefore, the elevated atmospheric CO concentration does not explain the estimated increase in global runoff over the last century. In contrast, we find that changes in mean climate, as well as its variability, do contribute to the global runoff increase. Using historic land-use data, we show that land-use change plays an additional important role in controlling regional runoff values, particularly in the tropics. Land-use change has been strongest in tropical regions, and its contribution is substantially larger than that of climate change. On average, land-use change has increased global runoff by 0.08 mm/year and accounts for â‰ˆ50\% of the reconstructed global runoff trend over the last century. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of land-cover change in forecasting future freshwater availability and climate.},

Annual peak flow data reveal that river flooding trends on the century scale do not show uniform changes across the country. While flood magnitudes in the Southwest have been decreasing, flood magnitudes in the Northeast and north-central United States have been increasing. Confounding the analysis of trends in river flooding is multiyear and even multidecadal variability likely caused by both large-scale atmospheric circulation changes and basin-scale ?memory? in the form of soil moisture. Droughts also have long-term trends as well as multiyear and decadal variability. Instrumental data indicate that the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the drought in the 1950s were the most significant twentieth-century droughts in the United States, while tree ring data indicate that the megadroughts over the twelfth century exceeded anything in the twentieth century in both spatial extent and duration.

When compared against this reference, the recent change appears statistically significant at the 5\% level. In order to investigate the reason for this local climatic change, the reconstruction was compared with the downscaled results of control and transient GCM scenarios (ECHAM4-OPYC3) and with the results obtained in a high-resolution time-slice experiment with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Both estimates are qualitatively consistent with the changes observed in the last 4 decades, We suggest that the recent increase in eastward propagation is a local manifestation of anthropogenic global climate change.},

The evaluation is focused on 12 regions of Australia for the daily simulation of precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature. The evaluation is based on probability density functions and a simple quantitative measure of how well each climate model can capture the observed probability density functions for each variable and each region is introduced. Across all three variables, the coupled climate models perform better than expected. Precipitation is simulated reasonably by most and very well by a small number of models, although the problem with excessive drizzle is apparent in most models. Averaged over Australia, 3 of the 14 climate models capture more than 80\% of the observed probability density functions for precipitation. Minimum temperature is simulated well, with 10 of the 13 climate models capturing more than 80\% of the observed probability density functions. Maximum temperature is also reasonably simulated with 6 of 10 climate models capturing more than 80\% of the observed probability density functions. An overall ranking of the climate models, for each of precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and averaged over these three variables, is presented. Those climate models that are skillful over Australia are identified, providing guidance on those climate models that should be used in impacts assessments where those impacts are based on precipitation or temperature. These results have no bearing on how well these models work elsewhere, but the methodology is potentially useful in assessing which of the many climate models should be used by impacts groups.},

While being useful to model geophysical fields exhibiting a high degree of variability and discontinuity and including rainfall, they ignore the spatial trends embedded in the variability that are evident from large temporal aggregation of spatial fields. The modelling of rain fields using multifractals causes the information related to spatial heterogeneity, immensely important at some spatial scales, to be lost in the modelling process. A simple method to avoid this loss of the heterogeneity information is proposed. Instead of modelling rain fields directly as multifractals, a derived field M is modelled; this is the product of filtering observed rainfall snapshots with spatial heterogeneity as indicated by long term accumulations of rain fields. The validity of considering the field M as multifractal is investigated empirically. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated using a discrete cascade model on gauge-calibrated radar rainfall of central Japan at a daily scale. Important parameters of spatial rainfall, like the distribution of wet areas, spatial autocorrelation and rainfall intensity distributions at different geographic locations with different amounts of average rainfall, were faithfully reproduced by the proposed method.},

Department of Energy and National Center for Atmospheric Research Parallel Climate Model (DOE/NCAR PCM). This study focuses on three climate projections for the 21st century based on a 'business as usual' (BAU) global emissions scenario, evaluated with respect to a control climate scenario based on static 1995 emissions. Time-varying monthly PCM temperature and precipitation changes were statistically downscaled and temporally disaggregated to produce daily forcings that drove a macroscale hydrologic simulation model of the Columbia River basin at 1/4-degree spatial resolution. For comparison with the direct statistical downscaling approach, a dynamical downscaling approach using a regional climate model (RCM) was also used to derive hydrologic model forcings for 20-year subsets from the PCM control climate ( 1995 - 2015) scenario and from the three BAU climate ( 2040 - 2060) projections. The statistically downscaled PCM scenario results were assessed for three analysis periods ( denoted Periods 1 - 3: 2010 - 2039, 2040 - 2069, 2070 - 2098) in which changes in annual average temperature were + 0.5, + 1.3 and + 2.1 degreesC, respectively, while critical winter season precipitation changes were - 3, + 5 and + 1 percent. For RCM, the predicted temperature change for the 2040 - 2060 period was + 1.2 degreesC and the average winter precipitation change was - 3 percent, relative to the RCM control climate. Due to the modest changes in winter precipitation, temperature changes dominated the simulated hydrologic effects by reducing winter snow accumulation, thus shifting summer streamflow to the winter. The hydrologic changes caused increased competition for reservoir storage between firm hydropower and instream flow targets developed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act listing of Columbia River salmonids. We examined several alternative reservoir operating policies designed to mitigate reservoir system performance losses. In general, the combination of earlier reservoir refill with greater storage allocations for instream flow targets mitigated some of the negative impacts to flow, but only with significant losses in firm hydropower production ( ranging from - 9 percent in Period 1 to - 35 percent for RCM). Simulated hydropower revenue changes were less than 5 percent for all scenarios, however, primarily due to small changes in annual runoff.},

	abstract = {A hybrid (physical-statistical) scheme is developed to resolve the finescale distribution of daily precipitation over complex terrain. The scheme generates precipitation by combining information from the upper-air conditions and From sparsely distributed station measurements: thus, it proceeds in two steps. First, an initial estimate of the precipitation is made using a simplified orographic precipitation model. It is a steady-state, multilayer, and two-dimensional model following the concepts of Rhea, The model is driven by the 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees gridded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Centers for Environmental Prediction upper-air profiles, and its parameters are tuned using the observed precipitation structure of the region, Precipitation is generated assuming a forced lifting of the air parcels as they cross the mountain barrier following a straight trajectory. Second, the precipitation is adjusted using errors between derived precipitation and observations from nearby sites. The study area covers the northern half of California, including coastal mountains, central valley, and the Sierra Nevada. The model is run for a 5-km rendition of terrain for days of January-March over the period of 1988-95. A jackknife analysis demonstrates the validity of the approach. The spatial and temporal distributions of the simulated precipitation field agree well with the observed precipitation, Further, a mapping of model performance indices (correlation coefficients, model bias, root-mean-square error, and threat scores) from an array of stations from the region indicates that the model performs satisfactorily in resolving daily precipitation at 5-km resolution.},

	title = {The relation of surface forcing of the {Bering} {Sea} to large- scale climate patterns},
	volume = {49},
	abstract = {Climate fluctuations, or modes, are largely manifested in terms of coherent, large-scale (similar to 3000 km) patterns of anomalous sea-level pressure or geopotential height at various altitudes. It is worthwhile to investigate how these modes relate to the specific processes associated with atmospheric forcing of the ocean, in this case for the southeast Bering Sea. This approach has been termed "downscaling." Climate-scale patterns in this study are derived from covariance-based empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of low-pass filtered (10- day cut-oft) 700-mb geopotential height fields for 1958-1999. By design, this EOF analysis elicits sets of patterns for characterizing the variability in the large-scale atmospheric circulation centered on the Bering Sea. Four modes are considered for each of three periods, January-March, April-May, and June-July. These modes are compared with atmospheric circulation patterns formed by compositing 700-mb height anomalies based on the individual elements constituting the local forcing, i.e. the surface heat and momentum fluxes. In general, different aspects of local forcing are associated with different climate modes. In winter, the modes dominating the forcing of sea-ice include considerable interannual variability, but no discernible long-term trends. A prominent shift did occur around 1977 in the sign of a winter mode resembling the Pacific North American pattern; this mode is most significantly related to the local wind-stress curl. In spring, forcing of currents and stratification are related to the two leading climate modes, one resembling the North Pacific (NP) pattern and one reflecting the strength of the Aleutian low; both exhibit long-term trends with implications for the Bering Sea. In summer, an NP-like mode and a mode featuring a center over the Bering Sea include long-term trends with impacts on surface heating and wind mixing, respectively. Rare events, such as a persistent period of strong high pressure or a major storm, also can dominate the summer Bering Sea forcing in particular years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {A statistical downscaling methodology was implemented to generate daily time series of temperature and rainfall for point locations within a catchment, based on the output from general circulation models. The rainfall scenarios were constructed by a two-stage process. First, for a single station, a conditional first-order Markov chain was used to generate wet and dry day successions. Then, the multisite scenarios were constructed by sampling from a benchmark file containing a daily time series of multiple-site observations, classified by season, circulation weather type, and whether the day is wet or dry at the reference station. The temperature scenarios were constructed using deterministic transfer functions initialized by free atmosphere variables. The relationship between the temperature and rainfall scenarios is established in two ways. First, sea level pressure fields define the circulation weather types underpinning the rainfall scenarios and are used to construct predictor variables in the temperature scenarios. Second, separate temperature transfer functions are developed for wet and dry days. The methods were evaluated in two Mediterranean catchments. The rainfall scenarios were always too dry, despite the application of Monte Carlo techniques in an attempt to overcome the problem. The temperature scenarios were generally too cool. The scenarios were used to explore the occurrence of extreme events, and the changes predicted in response to climate change, taking the example of temperature. The nonlinear relationship between changes in the mean and changes at the extremes was clearly demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Global warming is expected to lead to a large increase in atmospheric water vapor content and to changes in the hydrological cycle, which include an intensification of precipitation extremes. The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

	abstract = {Statistical atmospheric rainfall downscaling, that is, statistical estimation of local or regional rainfall on the basis of large-scale atmospheric circulation, has been advocated to make the output from global and regional climate models more accurate for a particular location or basin. Neural networks (NNs) have been used for such downscaling, but their application has proved problematic, mainly due to the numerous zero-values present in short-term rainfall time series. In the present study, using serially coupled NNs was tested as a way to improve performance. Mean 12-hour rainfall in the Chikugo River basin, Kyushu Island, Southern Japan, was downscaled from observations of precipitable water and zonal and meridional wind speed at 850 hPa, averaged over areas within which the temporal variation was found to be significantly correlated with basin rainfall. Basin rainfall was ranked into tour categories: no-rain (0) and low (1), high (2) and extreme (3) intensity, A series of NN experiments showed that the best overall performance in terms of hit rates was achieved by a two-stage approach in which a first NN distinguished between no-rain (0) and rain (1-3), and a second NN distinguished between low, high, and extreme rainfalls. Using either a single NN to distinguish between all four categories or three NNs to successively detect extreme values proved inferior. The results demonstrate the need for an elaborate configuration when using NNs for short-term, downscaling, and the importance of including physical considerations in the NN application.

Usando 94 estaciones pluviométricas de registro diario, se calcularon los ciclos anuales promedio dominantes en la región centroamericana por medio del análisis de funciones ortogonales empíricas. Esto permitió estimar aspectos importantes del ciclo anual tales como el inicio y término de la estación lluviosa así como el período de veranillo o canícula, notándose una variación latitudinal de los mismos. Se encontró que la región está dominada por un ciclo anual promedio que captura cerca del 72\% de la varianza. Este ciclo anual está explicado por una combinación de sistemas y parámetros que involucran la migración latitudinal de la ZCIT, la variación estacional de la radiación solar, que influye sobre el flujo de calor latente, y el viento en bajo nivel y su interacción con la orografía, principalmente. El segundo ciclo anual en importancia explica sólo el 8\% de la varianza en la región. Este dominó en estaciones ubicadas sobre la costa Caribe de Honduras, Costa Rica y Panamá. La precipitación en Centroamérica presentó relaciones distintas con los océanos Atlántico y Pacífico tropical en las escalas interanuales y decadales. En la escala interanual, los años más húmedos (secos) en la región estuvieron relacionados en general con anomalías de la temperatura superficial del mar más cálidas (frías) en el Atlántico Tropical que en el Pacífico Tropical Este.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT This study explores the predictive skill of seasonal rainfall characteristics for the first rainy (and planting) season, May?June, in Central America. Statistical predictive models were built using a Model Output Statistics (MOS) technique based on canonical correlation analysis, in which variables that forecast with the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) were used as candidate predictors for the observed total precipitation, frequency of rainy days and mean number of extremely dry and wet events in the season. CFSv2 initializations from February to April were explored. The CFSv2 variables used in the study consist of rainfall, as in a typical MOS technique, and a combination of low-level winds and convective available potential energy (CAPE), a blend that has been previously shown to be a good predictor for convective activity. The highest predictive skill was found for the seasonal frequency of rainy days, followed by the mean frequency of dry events. In terms of candidate predictors, the zonal transport of CAPE (uCAPE) at 925?hPa offers higher skill across Central America than rainfall, which is attributed in part to the high model uncertainties associated with precipitation in the region. As expected, dynamical model predictors initialized in February provide lower skill than those initialized later. Nonetheless, the skill is comparable for March and April initializations. These results suggest that the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in Central America, and the Central American Regional Climate Outlook Forum, can produce earlier more skilful forecasts for May?June rainfall characteristics than previously stated.},

The CMIP6 ensemble reproduces the observed annual cycle and distribution of mean annual temperature and precipitation with biases between − 0.93 and 1.27 °C and − 37.90 to 58.45\%, respectively, for most of the region. However, modeled precipitation is too large over the western and Midwestern U.S. during winter and spring and over the North American monsoon region in summer, while too small over southern Central America. Temperature is projected to increase over the entire domain under all three SSPs, by as much as 6 °C under SSP5-8.5, and with more pronounced increases in the northern latitudes over the regions that receive snow in the present climate. Annual precipitation projections for the end of the twenty-first century have more uncertainty, as expected, and exhibit a meridional dipole-like pattern, with precipitation increasing by 10–30\% over much of the U.S. and decreasing by 10–40\% over Central America and the Caribbean, especially over the monsoon region. Seasonally, precipitation over the eastern and central subregions is projected to increase during winter and spring and decrease during summer and autumn. Over the monsoon region and Central America, precipitation is projected to decrease in all seasons except autumn. The analysis was repeated on a subset of 9 models with the best performance in the reference period; however, no significant difference was found, suggesting that model bias is not strongly influencing the projections.},

(REA and REA Xu) method and an unweighted mean were used to generate multi-model ensembles of 14 general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for a baseline (1971?2000) period and future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the 21st century. To test the consistency of the REA ensembles at different scales, one ensemble was area-averaged at regional scale and two were obtained at 50-km gridpoints. Climatic metrics of temperature and precipitation during the baseline period served to evaluate the performance of the GCMs and the ensembles in the North American monsoon (NAM) and the mid-summer drought (MSD) regions. The metrics of the three REA ensembles are very similar among them in each region and show a better performance than the unweighted multi-model ensemble (U-MME). The majority of the GCMs overestimate winter precipitation in the NAM and fail to retract the end of the monsoon in autumn; REA ensembles reduce this overestimation. All ensembles capture well the MSD's double peak of rainfall, but underestimate summer precipitation. According to all ensembles, temperature increases of 1.5?2 °C in the two regions may be reached between 2035 and 2055 relative to the baseline, and by 2070?2099 temperature (precipitation) in Mexico may increase (decrease) between 2° C (5\%) and 5.8 °C (10\%) in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Annual changes of precipitation show a north (positive) and south of 35°N (negative) pattern. The largest impacts are expected during summer with a possible decrease of {\textasciitilde}13\% (up to ?1.5 mm/day), especially in southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, while autumn precipitation may slightly increase. Future projections from the REA Xu (by gridpoint) ensemble show spatial patterns similar to the U-MME, but with more regional detail, which could be an added value for regional climate impact studies.},

The MSD appears in early-June over Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and develops progressively later in the summer season towards the west, finally occurring in early-October over the Gulf of Mexico. The MSD is most intense in the eastern Pacific, strong and significant in the western Caribbean, and almost nonexistent in the eastern Caribbean.

A July increase in surface pressure and surface divergence, caused by the changing wind field, appears to contribute to a strong concurrent MSD over the waters bounded by Jamaica, Cuba, and the Yucatan peninsula. Finally, the island of Jamaica itself appears to block the flow of the tradewinds as they migrate northward and intensify into mid-summer, thus enhancing the divergence, and in turn MSD, immediately to the west.},

	abstract = {[ABSTRACT:This study uses a novel data set of satellite-derived precipitation and reanalysis winds to describe variations in the diurnal cycle during the summer season in southern Mexico, Central America, and adjacent oceans, with the purpose of elucidating local forcing mechanisms of the midsummer drought (MSD). It is well established that precipitation peaks in the evening over land, while just off the Pacific coast the maximum is during the day. However, little is understood about the diurnal cycle of rainfall and winds associated with the MSD, a climatological phenomenon that impacts the local population. First, the MSD was quantified with the precipitation data and found to be strongest over Guatemala and El Salvador, consistent with previous studies. Over Guatemala the strength of the diurnal cycle follows the evolution of the MSD. Here evening precipitation rates are 25\% higher at the beginning and end of the summer compared to mid-summer, while daytime rates remain fairly constant throughout the season. To the south, over the Pacific, both daytime and nighttime precipitation rates are higher at the beginning and end of summer as compared to mid-summer. In June, surface winds in the vicinity of the Gulf of Tehuantepec are southerly during the evening and northerly during the day, dynamically consistent with the diurnal cycle of convection. In July-August and September, tradewind systems disturb this apparent local circulation cell bringing conditions conducive to reduced and enhanced rainfall respectively. In neighboring areas where the MSD is weak, precipitation and wind change little over land and ocean for the summer season. Thus, these results support earlier studies linking solar forcing of sea surface temperatures and changes in the large-scale circulation in the development of a strong but localized MSD.]},

The annual cycle of precipitation characteristic of the Pacific slope of this region presents a bimodal distribution on summertime, with two maxima and a relative intraseasonal minimum, known as the Mid-Summer Drought (MSD). In this study, the small-scale (tens of kilometers) variability of the MSD is analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed using the regional climate model RegCM4 over a Mesoamerican domain for a six-year period. ERA Interim reanalysis data is used as initial and lateral boundary conditions. The domain is subdivided into smaller areas and the average annual cycle of precipitation distribution is computed for each of them. The MSD pattern is found to present a high spatial variability in the intensity of its two maxima and even the total absence of its characteristic minimum. Such behavior is attributed to soil-atmosphere and terrain topography interactions that are better resolved with a regional climate model.},

	abstract = {This text began as a collection of class notes for a course on applied statistical methods for hydrologists taught at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Training Center. Course material was formalized and organized into a textbook, first published in 1992 by Elsevier as part of their Studies in Environmental Science series. In 2002, the work was made available online as a USGS report.The text has now been updated as a USGS Techniques and Methods Report. It is intended to be a text in applied statistics for hydrology, environmental science, environmental engineering, geology, or biology that addresses distinctive features of environmental data. For example, water resources data tend to have many variables with a lower bound of zero, tend to be more skewed than data from many other disciplines, commonly contain censored data (less than values), and assumptions that the data are normally distributed are not appropriate. Computer-intensive methods (bootstrapping and permutation tests) now improve upon and replace the dependence on t-intervals, t-tests, and analysis of variance. A new chapter on sampling design addresses questions such as “How many observations do I need?” The chapter also presents distribution-free methods to help plan sampling efforts. The trends chapter has been updated to include the WRTDS (Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season) method for analysis of water-quality data. This new version contains updated graphics and updated guidance on the use of statistical techniques. The text utilizes R, a programming language and open-source software environment, for all exercises and most graphics, and the R code used to generate figures and examples is provided for download.},

The area of interest is located mainly in the Pacific slope of Central America, from Chiapas in southern Mexico, to the Nicoya Peninsula in the Costa Rican North Pacific. Most of the region has experienced significant warming trends (1970–1999). On the contrary precipitation and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) have mainly displayed non-significant trends. Analysis using the Standardized Precipitation Index and PDSI in the CADC, suggests a significant periodicity of severe and sustained droughts of around 10 years. The drought response has been associated with tropical heating that drives an atmospheric response through strengthening of the Hadley cell, which in turn produces higher pressure in the subtropical highs, and intensification of the trade winds (indexed by the Caribbean Low Level Jet). It is important to determine the commonness of severe and sustained droughts in the CADC to improve water resources planning, as this is a region that depends on subsistence agriculture and presents high social and economic vulnerabilities.},

Each table in a conditional reference set of r × c tables with fixed marginal sums is assigned a generalized hypergeometric probability. The significance level is then computed by summing the probabilities of all tables that are no larger (on the probability scale) than the observed table. However, the computational effort required to generate all r × c contingency tables with fixed marginal sums severely limits the use of Fisher's exact test. A novel technique that considerably extends the bounds of computational feasibility of the exact test is proposed here. The problem is transformed into one of identifying all paths through a directed acyclic network that equal or exceed a fixed length. Some interesting new optimization theorems are developed in the process. The numerical results reveal that for sparse contingency tables Fisher's exact test and Pearson's χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ test frequently lead to contradictory inferences concerning row and column independence.]},

Recent climatic shifts in this highly diverse region are not well understood due to sparse observations, and as the skill of global climate products have not been thoroughly evaluated. We examine the performance for several reanalysis and satellite-based global climate data products (CHIRPS/CHIRTS, ERA5, MERRA-2, PERSIANN-CDR) as compared to the observation-based GPCC precipitation dataset. These datasets are then used to evaluate the magnitude and spatial extent of hydroclimatic shifts and changes in aridity and drought over the last four decades. We focus on water-limited regions that are important for rain-fed agriculture and particularly vulnerable to further drying, and newly delineate those regions for Central America and Mexico by adapting prior definitions of the Central American Dry Corridor. Our results indicate that the CHIRPS dataset exhibits the greatest skill for the study area. A general warming of 0.2–0.8°C·decade−1 was found across the region, particularly for spring and winter, while widespread drying was indicated by several measures for the summer growing season. Changes in annual precipitation have been inconsistent, but show declines of 20–25\% in eastern Honduras/Nicaragua and in several parts of Mexico. Some regions most vulnerable to drying have been subject to statistically significant trends towards summer drying, increases in drought and aridity driven by precipitation declines, and/or a lengthening of the winter dry season, highlighting areas where climate adaptation measures may be most urgent.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bimodal precipitation is a globally observed and regionally significant event that has a significant influence on the agriculture, public health, and insurance needs of associated regions. Many studies have focused on the mechanisms behind the generation and development of this event; however, little research into its characteristics exists due to a lack of a widely accepted method for accurate detection and quantification. Using a function collection containing various methods, different methods can be compared in terms of their performance in the detection and quantification of bimodal precipitation signals, allowing the proposal of appropriate criteria for method choice in various study types. Five methods (Mosiño and García, 1966; Curtis, 2002; Angeles et al., 2010; Karnauskas et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2020) are adapted to the Climate Prediction Centre data during 1979?2017 in the domain of southern Mexico and Central America, and their performances are evaluated and compared. While outputs from the five methods reach general consistence for strong bimodal features over the Pacific side of Central America and Yucatán Peninsula, some biases are identified, specifically shown by the fact that methods using monthly climatological data demonstrates bimodal precipitation over the Caribbean side of Central America, while those using daily annual data indicate the existence of bimodal precipitation over the Pacific side of southern Mexico. By comparing two typical algorithms, we determined that this bias was induced by the limitation of temporal resolution in monthly climatological data and the nature of algorithms applying daily annual data. As part of a case study, a cluster algorithm was applied to outputs from an algorithm using daily annual precipitation, and a classification algorithm was used to test clustering performance. The resultant general high accuracy shows that annual bimodal signals offer good adaption to cluster and other potential machine learning algorithms.},

We augment passive flood mapping (the so-called “bathtub” approach) by simulating physical processes posing recurrent threats to coastal infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems in Hawai‘i (including tidally-forced direct marine and groundwater flooding, seasonal wave inundation, and chronic coastal erosion). We find that the “bathtub” approach, alone, ignores 35–54 percent of the total land area exposed to one or more of these hazards, depending on location and SLR scenario. We conclude that modeling dynamic processes, including waves and erosion, is essential to robust SLR vulnerability assessment. Results also indicate that as sea level rises, coastal lands are exposed to higher flood depths and water velocities. The prevalence of low-lying coastal plains leads to a rapid increase in land exposure to hazards when sea level exceeds a critical elevation of {\textasciitilde}0.3 or 0.6 m, depending on location. At {\textasciitilde}1 m of SLR, land that is roughly seven times the total modern beach area is exposed to one or more hazards. Projected increases in extent, magnitude, and rate of persistent SLR impacts suggest an urgency to engage in long-term planning immediately.},

We present a weighting strategy for use with the CMIP5 multi-model archive in the fourth National Climate Assessment, which considers both skill in the climatological performance of models over North America as well as the inter-dependency of models arising from common parameterizations or tuning practices. The method exploits information relating to the climatological mean state of a number of projection-relevant variables as well as metrics representing long-term statistics of weather extremes. The weights, once computed can be used to simply compute weighted means and significance information from an ensemble containing multiple initial condition members from potentially co-dependent models of varying skill. Two parameters in the algorithm determine the degree to which model climatological skill and model uniqueness are rewarded; these parameters are explored and final values are defended for the assessment. The influence of model weighting on projected temperature and precipitation changes is found to be moderate, partly due to a compensating effect between model skill and uniqueness. However, more aggressive skill weighting and weighting by targeted metrics is found to have a more significant effect on inferred ensemble confidence in future patterns of change for a given projection.},

The method exploits information relating to the climatological mean state of a number of projection-relevant variables as well as metrics representing long-term statistics of weather extremes. The weights, once computed can be used to simply compute weighted means and significance information from an ensemble containing multiple initial condition members from potentially co-dependent models of varying skill. Two parameters in the algorithm determine the degree to which model climatological skill and model uniqueness are rewarded; these parameters are explored and final values are defended for the assessment. The influence of model weighting on projected temperature and precipitation changes is found to be moderate, partly due to a compensating effect between model skill and uniqueness. However, more aggressive skill weighting and weighting by targeted metrics is found to have a more significant effect on inferred ensemble confidence in future patterns of change for a given projection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            This study evaluates and compares historical simulations of daily sea-level pressure circulation types over 6 continental-scale regions (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, East Asia, and Australasia) by 15 pairs of global climate models from modeling centers that contributed to both Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and CMIP6. Atmospheric circulation classifications are constructed using two different methodologies applied to two reanalyses. Substantial improvements in performance, taking into account internal variability, are found between CMIP5 and CMIP6 for both frequency (24\% reduction in global error) and persistence (12\% reduction) of circulation types. Improvements between generations are robust to different methodological choices and reference datasets. A modest relationship between model resolution and skill is found. While there is large intra-ensemble spread in performance, the best performing models from CMIP6 exhibit levels of skill close to those from the reanalyses. In general, the latest generation of climate models should provide less biased simulations for use in regional dynamical and statistical downscaling efforts than previous generations.},

Its architecture employs a system of geographically distributed peer nodes that are independently administered yet united by common federation protocols and application programming interfaces (APIs). The full ESGF infrastructure has now been adopted by multiple Earth science projects and allows access to petabytes of geophysical data, including the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)—output used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports. Data served by ESGF not only include model output (i.e., CMIP simulation runs) but also include observational data from satellites and instruments, reanalyses, and generated images.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Uncertainty in model projections of future climate change arises due to internal variability, multiple possible emission scenarios, and different model responses to anthropogenic forcing. To robustly quantify uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, inter-dependencies between models as well as a models ability to reproduce observations should be considered. Here, a model weighting approach, which accounts for both independence and performance, is applied to European temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP5 archive. Two future periods representing mid- and end-of-century conditions driven by the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 are investigated. To inform the weighting, six diagnostics based on three observational estimates are used to also account for uncertainty in the observational record. Our findings show that weighting the ensemble can reduce the interquartile spread by more than 20\% in some regions, increasing the reliability of projected changes. The mean temperature change is most notably impacted by the weighting in the Mediterranean, where it is found to be 0.35 °C higher than the unweighted mean in the end-of-century period. For precipitation the largest differences are found for Northern Europe, with a relative decrease in precipitation of 2.4\% and 3.4\% for the two future periods compared to the unweighted case. Based on a perfect model test, it is found that weighting the ensemble leads to an increase in the investigated skill score for temperature and precipitation while minimizing the probability of overfitting.},

            An ‘emergent constraint’ (EC) is a statistical relationship, across a model ensemble, between a measurable aspect of the present day climate (the predictor) and an aspect of future projected climate change (the predictand). If such a relationship is robust and understood, it may provide constrained projections for the real world. Here, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models are used to revisit several ECs that were proposed in prior model intercomparisons with two aims: (1) to assess whether these ECs survive the partial out-of-sample test of CMIP6 and (2) to more rigorously quantify the constrained projected change than previous studies. To achieve the latter, methods are proposed whereby uncertainties can be appropriately accounted for, including the influence of internal variability, uncertainty on the linear relationship, and the uncertainty associated with model structural differences, aside from those described by the EC. Both least squares regression and a Bayesian Hierarchical Model are used. Three ECs are assessed: (a) the relationship between Southern Hemisphere jet latitude and projected jet shift, which is found to be a robust and quantitatively useful constraint on future projections; (b) the relationship between stationary wave amplitude in the Pacific-North American sector and meridional wind changes over North America (with extensions to hydroclimate), which is found to be robust but improvements in the predictor in CMIP6 result in it no longer substantially constrains projected change in either circulation or hydroclimate; and (c) the relationship between ENSO teleconnections to California and California precipitation change, which does not appear to be robust when using historical ENSO teleconnections as the predictor.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on the planet, with far-reaching global impacts. It is therefore key to evaluate ENSO simulations in state-of-the-art numerical models used to study past, present, and future climate. Recently, the Pacific Region Panel of the International Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) Project, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), led a community-wide effort to evaluate the simulation of ENSO variability, teleconnections, and processes in climate models. The new CLIVAR 2020 ENSO metrics package enables model diagnosis, comparison, and evaluation to 1) highlight aspects that need improvement; 2) monitor progress across model generations; 3) help in selecting models that are well suited for particular analyses; 4) reveal links between various model biases, illuminating the impacts of those biases on ENSO and its sensitivity to climate change; and to 5) advance ENSO literacy. By interfacing with existing model evaluation tools, the ENSO metrics package enables rapid analysis of multipetabyte databases of simulations, such as those generated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 (CMIP5) and 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 models are found to significantly outperform those from CMIP5 for 8 out of 24 ENSO-relevant metrics, with most CMIP6 models showing improved tropical Pacific seasonality and ENSO teleconnections. Only one ENSO metric is significantly degraded in CMIP6, namely, the coupling between the ocean surface and subsurface temperature anomalies, while the majority of metrics remain unchanged.},

	abstract = {Abstract. End users studying impacts and risks caused by human-induced climate change
are often presented with large multi-model ensembles of climate projections
whose composition and size are arbitrarily determined. An efficient and
versatile method that finds a subset which maintains certain key properties
from the full ensemble is needed, but very little work has been done in this
area. Therefore, users typically make their own somewhat subjective subset
choices and commonly use the equally weighted model mean as a best estimate.
However, different climate model simulations cannot necessarily be regarded
as independent estimates due to the presence of duplicated code and shared
development history. Here, we present an efficient and flexible tool that makes better use of the
ensemble as a whole by finding a subset with improved mean performance
compared to the multi-model mean while at the same time maintaining the
spread and addressing the problem of model interdependence. Out-of-sample
skill and reliability are demonstrated using model-as-truth experiments. This
approach is illustrated with one set of optimisation criteria but we also
highlight the flexibility of cost functions, depending on the focus of
different users. The technique is useful for a range of applications that,
for example, minimise present-day bias to obtain an accurate ensemble mean,
reduce dependence in ensemble spread, maximise future spread, ensure good
performance of individual models in an ensemble, reduce the ensemble size
while maintaining important ensemble characteristics, or optimise several of
these at the same time. As in any calibration exercise, the final ensemble is
sensitive to the metric, observational product, and pre-processing steps used.},

	abstract = {Abstract. An objective approach is presented for scoring coupled climate simulations through an evaluation
against satellite and reanalysis datasets during the satellite era (i.e., since 1979). The approach
is motivated, described, and applied to available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)
archives and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1 Large Ensemble archives with the
goal of robustly benchmarking model performance and its evolution across CMIP generations. A
scoring system is employed that minimizes sensitivity to internal variability, external forcings,
and model tuning. Scores are based on pattern correlations of the simulated mean state, seasonal
contrasts, and ENSO teleconnections. A broad range of feedback-relevant fields is considered and
summarized on discrete timescales (climatology, seasonal, interannual) and physical realms (energy
budget, water cycle, dynamics). Fields are also generally chosen for which observational
uncertainty is small compared to model structural differences. Highest mean variable scores across models are reported for well-observed fields such as sea level
pressure, precipitable water, and outgoing longwave radiation, while the lowest scores are reported
for 500 hPa vertical velocity, net surface energy flux, and precipitation minus
evaporation. The fidelity of models is found to vary widely both within and across CMIP
generations. Systematic increases in model fidelity in more recent CMIP generations are
identified, with the greatest improvements occurring in dynamic and energetic fields. Such
examples include shortwave cloud forcing and 500 hPa eddy geopotential height and relative
humidity. Improvements in ENSO scores with time are substantially greater than for climatology or
seasonal timescales. Analysis output data generated by this approach are made freely available online from a broad range
of model ensembles, including the CMIP archives and various single-model large ensembles. These
multimodel archives allow for an expeditious analysis of performance across a range of
simulations, while the CESM large ensemble archive allows for estimation of the influence of
internal variability on computed scores. The entire output archive, updated and expanded
regularly, can be accessed at http://webext.cgd.ucar.edu/Multi-Case/CMAT/index.html (last access: 18 August 2020).},

Here we review and synthesize the latest developments in ECS and TCR values in CMIP, compile possible reasons for the current values as supplied by the modeling groups, and highlight future directions. Cloud feedbacks and cloud-aerosol interactions are the most likely contributors to the high values and increased range of ECS in CMIP6.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) constitutes the latest update on expected future climate change based on a new generation of climate models. To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the CMIP6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation CMIP5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17 \% compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a CMIP6 “family tree”, which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis – ERA5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 – MERRA-2), to constrain CMIP6 projections under weak (SSP1-2.6) and strong (SSP5-8.5) climate change scenarios (SSP refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some CMIP6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014) for SSP5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7 ∘C, compared with 4.1 ∘C without weighting; the likely (66\%) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6 ∘C, which equates to a 13 \% decrease in spread. For SSP1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1 ∘C (0.7 to 1.4 ∘C), which results in a reduction of −0.1 ∘C in the mean and −24 \% in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The wintertime ENSO teleconnection over the North Pacific region consists of an intensified (weakened) low pressure center during El Niño (La Niña) events both in observations and in climate models. Here, it is demonstrated that this teleconnection persists too strongly into late winter and spring in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). This discrepancy arises in both fully coupled and atmosphere-only configurations, when observed SSTs are specified, and is shown to be robust when accounting for the sampling uncertainty due to internal variability. Furthermore, a similar problem is found in many other models from piControl simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (23 out of 43 in phase 5 and 11 out of 20 in phase 6). The implications of this bias for the simulation of surface climate anomalies over North America are assessed. The overall effect on the ENSO composite field (El Niño minus La Niña) resembles an overly prolonged influence of ENSO into the spring with anomalously high temperatures over Alaska and western Canada, and wet (dry) biases over California (southwest Canada). Further studies are still needed to disentangle the relative roles played by diabatic heating, background flow, and other possible contributions in determining the overly strong springtime ENSO teleconnection intensity over the North Pacific.},
