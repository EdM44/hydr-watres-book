In the second part of the book, these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book, a number of major spatial data analysis errors should no longer be made because of lack of knowledge. The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data cubes - array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery) datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud"--},

	abstract = {Abstract. The open-source programming language R has gained a central place in the hydrological sciences over the last decade, driven by the availability of diverse hydro-meteorological data archives and the development of open-source computational tools. The growth of R's usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the benefits and advantages of R's usage in hydrology, such as the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of a typical hydrological workflow based on reproducible principles and packages for retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, spatial analysis, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations and documents. We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation, and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of integrated development environments (IDEs); and the challenges of big data and parallel computing in hydrology. Lastly, this paper provides a roadmap for R's future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, application programming interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Following the rise of R as a scientific programming language, the increasing requirement for more transferable research and the growth of data availability in hydrology, R packages containing hydrological models are becoming more and more available as an open-source resource to hydrologists. Corresponding to the core of the hydrological studies workflow, their value is increasingly meaningful regarding the reliability of methods and results. Despite package and model distinctiveness, no study has ever provided a comparison of R packages for conceptual rainfall–runoff modelling from a user perspective by contrasting their philosophy, model characteristics and ease of use. We have selected eight packages based on our ability to consistently run their models on simple hydrology modelling examples. We have uniformly analysed the exact structure of seven of the hydrological models integrated into these R packages in terms of conceptual storages and fluxes, spatial discretisation, data requirements and output provided. The analysis showed that very different modelling choices are associated with these packages, which emphasises various hydrological concepts. These specificities are not always sufficiently well explained by the package documentation. Therefore a synthesis of the package functionalities was performed from a user perspective. This synthesis helps to inform the selection of which packages could/should be used depending on the problem at hand. In this regard, the technical features, documentation, R implementations and computational times were investigated. Moreover, by providing a framework for package comparison, this study is a step forward towards supporting more transferable and reusable methods and results for hydrological modelling in R.},

	abstract = {Research Bulletin 280, Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station, gives the results of runoff plat experiments by Jesse I. Neal [see 1 of “References” at end of paper]. The same sail was used in all the experiments. This was Putnam soil, taken from the surface five to six inches, from a timothy meadow. The soil was placed in a tank 12 feet long, 3.63 feet wide, and 26 inches deep. Water was applied by an overhead sprinkling applicator. Neal states: “Before each run the soil was dried and cultivated to a depth of 4 inches … After the moisture‐content of the surface four inches of soil had been reduced to between two‐thirds and three‐fourths of the capillary capacity, the surface‐soil was leveled off and worked down to approximately the proper height… After the soil was approximately leveled off with a rake, a wooden templet was drawn the length of the box and all excess soil scraped off. Since the templet left the soil in a smooth condition, the rake was run lightly back and forth across the slope to simulate the condition of a good seed‐bed… The surface‐inch of soil was further dried to between one‐fourth and one‐half the capillary capacity before applying the rain.” The rain was applied at intensities of approximately 4 inches, 3 inches, 2 inches, 1.5 inches, and 0.9 inch per hour, and the experiments were carried out with surface‐slopes of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 per cent.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is a crucial resource for current and future generations, but it is not being sustainably used in many parts of the world. The objective of this review is to provide a clear portrait of global-scale groundwater sustainability, systems, and resources in the Anthropocene to inspire a pivot toward more sustainable pathways of groundwater use. We examine groundwater from three different but related perspectives of sustainability science, natural resource governance and management, and Earth System science. An Earth System approach highlights the connections between groundwater and the other parts of the system and how these connections are impacting, or are impacted by, groundwater pumping. Groundwater is the largest store of unfrozen freshwater on Earth and is heterogeneously connected to many Earth System processes on different timescales. We propose a definition of groundwater sustainability that has a direct link with observable data, governance, and management as well as the crucial functions and services of groundwater. ▪  Groundwater is depleted or contaminated in some regions; it is ubiquitously distributed, which, importantly, makes it broadly accessible but also slow and invisible and therefore challenging to govern and manage. ▪  Regional differences in priorities, hydrology, politics, culture, and economic contexts mean that different governance and management tools are important, but a global perspective can support higher level international policies in an increasingly globalized world that require broader analysis of interconnections and knowledge transfer between regions. ▪  A coherent, overarching framework of groundwater sustainability is more important for groundwater governance and management than the concepts of safe yield, renewability, depletion, or stress.},

	abstract = {When a well is pumped or otherwise discharged, water‐levels in its neighborhood are lowered. Unless this lowering occurs instantaneously it represents a loss of storage, either by the un‐watering of a portion of the previously saturated sediments if the aquifer is nonartesian or by release of stored water by the compaction of the aquifer due to the lowered pressure if the aquifer is artesian. The mathematical theory of ground‐water hydraulics has been based, apparently entirely, on a postulate that equilibrium has been attained and therefore that water‐levels are no longer falling. In a great number of hydrologic problems, involving a well or pumping district near or in which water‐levels are falling, the current theory is therefore not strictly applicable. This paper investigates in part the nature and consequences of a mathematical theory that considers the motion of ground‐water before equilibrium is reached and, as a consequence, involves time as a variable.},
